%This furnace temperature control system does not work as well as operations personnel would like.  The temperature drifts around, unable to hold steady at setpoint, despite many attempts to adjust the ``tuning'' parameters in the TIC (proportional, integral, and derivative):

Dette temperaturreguleringssystemet for en ovn, virker ikke s{\aa} bra som operat{\o}rene skulle {\o}nske. Temperaturen driver rundt settpunktet, til tross for flere fors{\o}k p{\aa} optimalisere regulatoren ved {\aa} justere P, I og D parameterene.

%Finally a fellow instrument technician happens to notice the pressure gauge (PG) at the fuel oil pump discharge indicate an unsteady pressure.  Rather than hold constant at some value, the fuel oil pressure seems to rise and fall seemingly at random.
Til slutt ser en instrumentteknikker at trykkindikeringen p{\aa} utaket av oljepumpen indikerer et ustabilttrykk. Det ser ut til {\aa} {\o}ke og minke helt tilfeldig.

%Design a solution for this temperature-stability problem using a {\it cascade} control strategy, explaining the reasoning behind your solution.

\item{$\bullet$} Can you think of any solutions to this control dilemma other than cascade?
\item{$\bullet$} Why do you suppose there is a return valve in the fuel oil plumbing?
\item{$\bullet$} Explain what will happen in this system if someone suddenly shuts off the return valve, from its normal position.
\item{$\bullet$} Explain what will happen in this system if someone suddenly opens up the return valve, from its normal position.
