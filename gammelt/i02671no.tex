% Sketch a circuit whereby this loop-powered pressure transmitter sends a signal to an analog voltage meter (acting as a remote pressure gauge).  Include any necessary power sources and other electronic components in your completed circuit:
Tegn en krets der trykktransmitteren sender et signal til et voltmeter (som brukes for {\aa} indikere trykk i et kontrollrom). Ta med n{\o}dvendig str{\o}mforsyning.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Remember that loop-powered transmitters use the same two wires for power as well as for signal.  This means all components must be connected in series, with the battery functioning as a source, the transmitter functioning as a load, and the meter functioning as a load.

A helpful problem-solving strategy to apply here is sketching arrows at the terminals of each component, showing which way current needs to go.  This is where the status of each component as being either a source or a load becomes very important.
