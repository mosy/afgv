\item{$\bullet$} Identify at least one {\it mechanical} solution to this problem.
\item{$\bullet$} Explain the significance of the ``+'' symbols next to the summer input lines.  How well would the system work if one or more of these inputs were inverting (``$-$'') rather than non-inverting?
\item{$\bullet$} Suppose the suction produced at the discharge line by the pumps proved to be a significant load in the system (i.e. starting or stopping pumps caused excursions in the vessel's level).  Explain how you might incorporate feedforward control to stabilize liquid level against that load.
