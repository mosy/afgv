%Explain the difference(s) between an {\it AC} magnetic flowmeter and a {\it DC} magnetic flowmeter.  Also, describe why there are two types (i.e. what advantages do each type of magnetic flowmeter enjoy?)
Forklar forskjellen mellom AC og DC versjonene av elektromagnetiske flowmeter. Forklar ogs{\aa} hvilke styrker de to typene har.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

``AC'' flowmeters indeed use alternating current to energize their field windings, but ``DC'' meters do not use steady direct current.  Rather, ``DC'' flowmeters use {\it pulsed} magnetic fields, sometimes of consistent polarity and other times with reversing polarity (making them ``alternating'' after all!).

Dual-frequency magflow meters attempt to capitalize on the best features of both DC and AC techniques, by employing specialized pulse waveforms.

\vskip 10pt

DC magflow meters enjoy good rejection of ``noise'' voltages, while AC magflow meters typically exhibit faster response times.
