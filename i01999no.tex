%This paint mixing system mixes (clear) base and (colored) pigment to achieve a desired coloring, according to the ratio setpoint:

Dette systemet for malingsblanding, blander base og pigmet for {\aa} oppn{\aa} {\o}nsket farge. Fargen styres av setpunktet. 

$$\epsfbox{i01999x01.eps}$$

% Determine what will happen to the paint's color over time if the base flowmeter turbine seizes so that it does not turn even when there is adequate flow through the pipe.  Also, explain {\it why} the paint's color will be affected as you predict.

Hva vil skje med fargen om flowmetert til basestr{\o}mmen slutter {\aa} virke. Forklar ogs{\aa} hvorfor dette vil skje.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The paint will become less and less colored over time, as the control system shuts off the flow of pigment entirely.  This will happen because the ratio control system sees no base flow anymore, and thus turns off the pigment flow to match.
