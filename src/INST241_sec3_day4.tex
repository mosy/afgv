\vskip 5pt \hrule \vskip 5pt \noindent {\bf Question 61} -- LIII (high-accuracy flow measurement) \vskip 10pt

Pressure-based flow elements deviate from ``ideal'' behavior due to a number of factors including compressibility of the fluid, pipe roughness, energy losses due to friction and viscosity, etc.  In order to more accurately predict the flow/pressure relationship for an element such as an orifice plate, we have several other factors included in high-accuracy flow equations.  These include {\it discharge coefficient} ($C$ -- the ratio between true flow rate and theoretical flow rate), {\it gas expansion factor} ($Y$ -- ratio of the gas discharge coefficient to the liquid discharge coefficient for an element), and {\it compressibility factor} ($Z$).

\vskip 10pt

Live parameters such as gas pressure and gas temperature have particular influence on the accuracy of gas flow measurement because they affect the density ($\rho$) of the gas, which of course is an important variable in any DP-based flow formula.  The AGA3 gas flow equation compensates for these variables (as well as $C$, $Y$, and $Z$), and AGA3-compliant gas flow measurement systems must include RTD temperature sensors and absolute pressure sensors in addition to the differential pressure sensor in order to accurately calculate gas flow.  A ``gas flow computer'' takes in these three variables to compute flow rate.  Special {\it multi-variable} transmitters sensing all three of these variables and equipped with the AGA3 gas flow equation may serve the same purpose, computing flow rate and reporting that calculated variable instead of just reporting DP.

\vskip 10pt

For custody transfer (``fiscal'') flow measurement applications, {\it honed meter runs} are used instead of regular pipe.  These precision-machined tubes have mirror-smooth interior surfaces and precisely known dimensions.

\vskip 10pt

In order to improve the inherently poor turndown ratio of orifice-based flowmeters, several honed meter runs may be paralleled through shut-off valves: as flow increases, more valves are opened up to bring additional meter runs on-line, keeping the velocity through all of them within a narrow range where the accuracy is greatest.

\vskip 10pt

Liquid flow measurement applications may also benefit from compensation, but only temperature and not pressure because pressure changes have such a slight effect on liquid density (whereas temperature changes have a much more dramatic effect on liquid density).

Figure 2-3 on page 206 shows mounting positions for different services: above the pipe for gas, level with the pipe for gas or liquid, below the pipe for steam.

\vskip 10pt

The Rosemount model 3095 MV uses an RTD to sense process fluid temperature which is ideal given the superior linearity of RTDs (compared to thermocouples and thermistors) and the modest temperature range one would expect from a gas or liquid flowing through an orifice plate.

$N$ = Unit conversion factor

\filbreak \vskip 5pt \hrule \vskip 5pt \noindent {\bf Question 63} -- Rosemount orifice plate elements manual \vskip 10pt

A {\it meter section} is a {\it flange union} with pre-welded straight tubes both upstream and downstream.  The pre-welded tubes help ensure better accuracy than what might be achieved with field-welded pipe, since both the tubes and the welds are more likely to be smooth coming from the factory than assembled in the field.

\vskip 10pt

The standard meter sections listed in Appendix C exhibit a typical upstream straight-pipe length of ten (10) diameters and a downstream straight-pipe length of five (5) diameters.

\vskip 10pt

Regulators and throttling control valves seem to present the greatest level of disturbance, as measured by the necessary upstream straight-pipe run requirements (nearly 45 diameters with a beta ratio of 0.75).

\vskip 10pt

For the double-elbow installation, $D$ upstream (minimum) = 25 diameters and $D$ downstream (minimum) = 4 diameters.

The calibration error is a {\it zero} shift, and it resides in the DAC.  Thus, the transmitter needs its output to be trimmed.

The bypass valve being left open is only possible if the bypass valve's flow exceeds the desired acid flow even with FV-23 shut.  Otherwise, the ratio control system will still be able to maintain the correct ratio.

\filbreak \vskip 5pt \hrule \vskip 5pt \noindent {\bf Question 69} -- identifying location of calibration error in a flow loop \vskip 10pt

The problem is in the transmitter: it has a +1 "W.C. zero-shift (i.e. it ``thinks'' the applied pressure is 1 "W.C. greater than it actually is).

\vskip 10pt

Having measurements of transmitter current is extremely helpful because it gives us data we may use to independently assess the calibration of the transmitter versus the calibration of the indicator.  Without this ``measurement in the middle,'' the transmitter and indicator act as a single instrument with one input and one output, making it difficult to discern which half of the loop has the problem.
