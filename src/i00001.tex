We will begin our introduction to the second year of the Instrumentation program by brainstorming responses to a few questions:

\vskip 20pt

\noindent
{\bf (1) What are your goals in this program?  Why did you enroll in it and what do you expect to get out of it?}

\vskip 20pt

\noindent
{\bf (2) What career options exist within the field of instrumentation and control?}

\vskip 20pt

\noindent
{\bf (3) What knowledge and skills are most important for your success in this career?  Or, to state it differently, what benefit do employers get in return for the wages they pay you?}

\vskip 20pt

%\noindent
%{\bf (4) How do we get from here to there?  In other words, what can we do together within the span of a year to get you from where you are now to realizing your goals and being successful in this career?}

Here is a collection of typical answers from previous students addressing question \#1 (goals of enrolling in Instrumentation):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} To achieve job security
\item{} To gain a sense of doing something important in life
\item{} To have respect on the job
\item{} To be financially stable
\item{} To provide for family
\item{} To use your mind instead of doing menial work
\end{itemize}

In 2009, the {\it Industrial Instrumentation and Control Technology Alliance} (IICTA) conducted a survey of 23 industrial instrumentation experts from across the United States to rank the relative importance of knowledge and skill areas listed on the {\it Texas Skill Standards Board} (TSSB) skill standard for ``Industrial Instrumentation and Controls Technician.''  The following is a list of knowledge/skill areas from this skill standard where ``critically important'' (the absolute highest importance) was the most popular vote of the experts surveyed, along with the percentage of experts voting the knowledge/skill area as ``critical'', and also my own qualitative judgment of how difficult it is for someone to first acquire that knowledge or skill:

In December of 2001, the question ``What qualities should an Instrumentation graduate possess in order to excel in their profession?'' was posed to representatives on the Advisory Committee for BTC's Instrumentation program.  In addition to a firm knowledge of fundamentals (electronics, physics, mathematics, process control), one advisor in particular noted that ``self-direction and the ability to learn on your own'' was even more important than these.  

\vskip 10pt

Do you see a pattern emerging from a comparison of these feedback results?  As any economist can tell you, the highest-valued commodity is one with the greatest demand {\it and} the least supply.  Which knowledge/skill area do you see in these survey results meeting {\it both} criteria?  Are there other (lesser-valued) knowledge/skill areas of high value as defined by the same criteria of low supply and high demand?

The same Washington state board survey also provided a sobering statistic regarding on-the-job training.  The survey question read, ``Did you firm provide at least 4 hours of on-the-job training under a written plan for any employees in the last 12 months?''  The responses were only 31\% yes and 69\% no.

If you plan to review the various industries depicted in the answer section (in photographic form), a good focal point of discussion is to point out some of the continuing education you will likely face working in each industry.  For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\bf Electric power generation:} learning how the specialized control systems for electrical generators work, adapting to changes in the industry such as decentralized power production (e.g. wind farms, solar generators, energy storage facilities).
\itemitem{} Example: specialized processes (e.g. nuclear reactors, geothermal wells, wind turbines)
\itemitem{} Example: protective relays
\itemitem{} Example: ``smart grid'' instrumentation
\itemitem{} Example: control network encyption and security
\item{} {\bf Oil and natural gas exploration/production:} learning how to monitor and control state-of-the art resource extraction technologies such as horizontal drilling and deep-sea production, learning the characteristics of production processes in order to optimize control and safety shutdown systems.
\itemitem{} Example: deep-sea wellhead instrumentation
\itemitem{} Example: horizontal drilling
\itemitem{} Example: maximizing wellbore yield
\itemitem{} Example: custody transfer instrumentation
\item{} {\bf Oil refining:} few types of manufacturing facilities offer as much technological complexity in one site as an oil refinery -- you can spend an entire career learning about the processes and technologies used in a typical refinery without ever reaching the end!
\itemitem{} Example: steam generation, power generation, water treatment
\itemitem{} Example: catalytic chemical reaction processes
\itemitem{} Example: hazardous materials extraction (e.g. anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen sulfide)
\itemitem{} Example: new processes for refining challenging feedstocks such as ``light tight oil'' from the Bakken shale and other plays
\item{} {\bf Coal gasification:} learning how to measure and control relatively new technologies such as slagging gasifiers.
\itemitem{} Example: optical interferometric temperature sensors
\itemitem{} Example: hazardous materials extraction (e.g. anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen sulfide)
\item{} {\bf Chemical processing:} typically these facilities are very diverse, and harbor a number of high-level hazards.
\itemitem{} Example: catalytic chemical reaction processes
\itemitem{} Example: hazardous materials extraction (e.g. anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen sulfide)
\item{} {\bf Wood pulping and paper production:} a pulp \& paper mill is nearly as diverse as an oil refinery with respect to instrumentation.  An added technical challenge with legacy paper mills is that they tend to employ everything from old pneumatic instrumentation to the latest state-of-the-art systems -- in other words, old technology doesn't seem to get updated as often as it would at an oil refinery.
\itemitem{} Example: pulp consistency control, which is unique to this industry
\itemitem{} Example: ``hog fuel'' boiler controls, challenging due to the inconsist nature of wood waste (``hog'') fuel
\itemitem{} Example: recovery boiler operations (very dangerous processes, known for their history of explosive failure)
\item{} {\bf Pharmaceutical manufacturing:} learning the production requirements of new product lines, learning how to calibrate and maintain the latest in biological instrumentation.  
\itemitem{} Example: specialized analytical instrumentation for measuring drug quality
\item{} {\bf Food processing and packaging:} learning how to apply automation to reduce the cost and increase availability of food.
\itemitem{} Example: most food processing facilities are not big enough to sustain a large maintenance staff, and so the ``instrument tech'' must do many other technical duties (e.g. electrical, mechanical)
\item{} {\bf Alcohol production and bottling:} learning how to apply automation to small-scale craft brewery/distillery operations.
\itemitem{} Example: most small breweries and distilleries are not big enough to sustain a large maintenance staff, and so the ``instrument tech'' must do many other technical duties (e.g. electrical, mechanical)
\item{} {\bf Municipal water and wastewater treatment:} learning how to maintain the specialized instruments used to measure the quality of water, and how to control new processes for cleaning the water.
\itemitem{} Example: analyzers for detecting contaminants such as cryptosporidium and biological agents such as anthrax
\itemitem{} Example: new processes for treating water contaminated with medical waste
\item{} {\bf Electric power generation:} learning how the specialized control systems for electrical generators work, adapting to changes in the industry such as decentralized power production (e.g. wind farms, solar generators, energy storage facilities).
\itemitem{} Example: protective relays
\itemitem{} Example: ``smart grid'' instrumentation
\itemitem{} Example: control network encyption and security
\item{} {\bf Instrument control circuit layout and design:} learning new software packages such as {\tt InTools} for documenting instrumentation systems.
\item{} {\bf PLC programming (control system design engineering):} learning new brands and models of PLCs, as well as new programming languages.
\item{} {\bf Renewable energy:} all the challenges of a regular power generation facility, plus the complexities of an energy source that varies uncontrollably!
\item{} {\bf Mining:} learning about the specialized instrumentation used to assay ores in real time, plus the challenges of controlling machinery and processes in extremely harsh conditions.
\item{} {\bf Control valve service:} learning how to apply state-of-the-art ``smart'' instrumentation to the control of bulky valve mechanisms, learning about metallurgy and process fluid reactions in order to diagnose early valve failures.  
\item{} {\bf Contract instrumentation work:} every day brings a new challenge as the nature and location of the work constantly changes!
\end{itemize}

In the interest of leaving enough time to do the mastery exam, your review of these different industries should be brief.
