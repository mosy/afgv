Area (symbol: $A$) is the measurement of two-dimensional space.  

\vskip 10pt

Area may be expressed in terms of squared distance units (square inches, square miles, square centimeters, etc.), or in special units unique to the variable of area (such as acre or hectare).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Examples of area include the size of a land plot as viewed from the air, or the size of a dinner plate surface.  It has height and width, but no thickness.

The only ``special'' area units are English.  Metric area units are always squared distance units (square centimeters, square meters, square kilometers).
