%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Volume (symbol: $V$) is the measurement of three-dimensional space.

\vskip 10pt

Like area, volume may be expressed in terms of cubed distance units (cubic inches, cubic miles, cubic centimeters, etc.), or in special units unique to the variable of area (such as the English unit of ``gallon'' or the metric unit of ``liter'').

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Examples of volume include the capacity of a gasoline can, or the solid displacement quantity of a brick.  Volume may refer to solid spaces as well as hollow spaces.  It has height and width and depth all together.
The only ``special'' area units are English.  Metric area units are always squared distance units (square centimeters, square meters, square kilometers).
