Suppose an instrument technician connects a multimeter (set to measure millivolts DC) to the ends of a thermocouple cable, the other end of the cable terminating in a thermocouple junction inserted into a hot process.

\vskip 10pt

Assuming the multimeter registers 25.841 millivolts, with an ambient temperature of 53 degrees Fahrenheit at the connection point where the technician is at, and type N thermocouple cable throughout, determine the process temperature in degrees Celsius.  Be sure to show all your work (including all values taken from a thermocouple table)!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The all-important principle to bear in mind here is that every complete thermocouple circuit has {\it two} dissimilar-metal junctions: a measurement junction and a reference junction, with polarities opposed.  The measuring instrument always sees the {\it difference} between those junctions' voltages due to the opposing polarities:

$$V_{meter} = V_{meas} - V_{ref}$$

Therefore, in order to determine the temperature of the measurement junction, we must manipulate this formula to solve for $V_{meas}$ and plug in the known values:

\vskip 10pt

Reference junction (53 $^{o}$F) = 0.305 mV

$$V_{meas} = V_{meter} + V_{ref}$$

$$V_{meas} = 25.841 \hbox{ mV} + 0.305 \hbox{ mV}$$

$$V_{meas} = 26.146 \hbox{ mV}$$

Referencing a type N thermocouple table, we see the following temperatures corresponding to 26.146 millivolts:

\vskip 10pt

$T_{process}$ = 1366 to 1367 degrees Fahrenheit (approximate)

$T_{process}$ = 1366.23 degrees Fahrenheit (exact)

\vskip 10pt

$T_{process}$ = {\bf 741 to 742 degrees Celsius (approximate)}

$T_{process}$ = {\bf 741.24 degrees Celsius (exact)}
