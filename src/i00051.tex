\begin{itemize}
\item{} Orifice plate: {\it square root extraction required}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Magnetic: {\it inherently linear}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Pitot tube: {\it square root extraction required}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Mass flow (thermal): {\it technically, the relationship between detected temperature and flow rate is nonlinear, but since the conditioning is typically done with electronics located immediately at the sensing element, these instruments are often considered to have linear outputs}.
