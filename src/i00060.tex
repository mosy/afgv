This illustration shows a port-guided globe valve with a {\it linear} throttling characteristic:

Describe {\it and} sketch what would have to be modified in this valve to give it an {\it equal-percentage} throttling characteristic.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order to convert a {\it linear} valve plug into an {\it equal-percentage} valve plug, we need to re-shape the plug such that it ``opens slower'' than before.  In other words, its throttling curve needs to be re-shaped in such a way that it presents a smaller opening at low stem positions than it did before, while opening up just as far as it did before when the plug is fully retracted from the seat.

Port-guided globe valve plugs always remain in contact with the seat ring for guidance and support.  Unlike stem-guided plugs which fully retract out of the seat, a port-guided plug always keeps part of itself inserted into the seat bore.  This means the portion of the plug that does the throttling at low stem positions is located close to the sealing surface on the upper portion of the plug.  In other words, the top of the curve is where the throttling occurs as the valve just begins to open up.

Therefore, in order to make this valve plug open up ``slower'' than before, the curved notch needs to begin narrower than before, and then aggressively open up to full width toward the bottom:

%If this new equal-percentage plug shape does not present as full an opening at the 100\% position as it did when shaped for a linear characteristic, we could trim the plug to be shorter (and therefore be
