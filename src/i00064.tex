A control valve positioner may be thought of as a special type of process controller.  Like all process controllers, it has three external signals:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Process variable
\item{} Setpoint
\item{} Output
\end{itemize}

Identify what each of these variables is in the context of a positioner attached to a control valve, explaining what the ``process'' is that the positioner is controlling.
