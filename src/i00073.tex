Sketch the traces for controller output and process variable for two scenarios: one where the process is {\it integrating}, and the other where there is {\it dead time} in the process measurement.  In both cases, assume the controller has been placed in manual mode, and given a small step change.  Your sketches should show this step change along with the process variable response:

{\bf Integrating process:}
