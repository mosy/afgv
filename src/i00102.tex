Sally needs to dispense 1-1/2 pints of flour into a bowl in preparation to bake bread.  Unfortunately, someone has stolen her measuring cups, leaving her with nothing but a teaspoon.  How many teaspoons of flour must Sally count to equal 1-1/2 pints?

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf Conversion factors:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons
\item{} 16 tablespoons = 1 cup
\item{} 4 quarts = 1 gallon
\item{} 2 cups = 1 pint
\end{itemize}

Be sure to show how you used these conversion equivalents to get your answer!

1.5 pints = 144 teaspoons

\vskip 10pt

In this problem, the conversion factor of 4 quarts to 1 gallon is completely irrelevant.  I just threw that one in the list to be tricky.

The most straight-forward conversion technique would be pints (the given quantity) into cups, then cups into tablespoons, then tablespoons into teaspoons, like this:

$${{1.5 \hbox{ pints}} \over {1}} \times {{2 \hbox{ cups}} \over {1 \hbox{ pint}}} \times {{16 \hbox{ tbsp}} \over {1 \hbox{ cup}}} \times {{3 \hbox{ tsp}} \over {1 \hbox{ tbsp}}}$$

After canceling the units of pints, cups, and tablespoons, you are left with 144 teaspoons as the answer.
