In Europe, automobile engines are rated in kilowatts (kW) instead of horsepower (hp).  How many kilowatts would a 250 horsepower engine be rated at?  Be sure to show how you performed the conversion.

250 hp = 186.425 kW

In America, the unit of ``watt'' is typically linked with electrical power, while mechanical power is almost always rated in the unit of ``horsepower.''  So, while it may seem odd for an engine to be rated in units of kilowatts (or for that matter, a light bulb rated in horsepower!), our preference of units is nothing more than {\it convention}.  Both watts and horsepower are valid units of measurement for any form of power, be it electrical, mechanical, optical, or otherwise.

The conversion between horsepower and watts is quite simple: 745.7 watts to one horsepower.  The conversion calculation (using a unity fraction) will therefore look like this:

$${250 \hbox{ HP} \over 1} \times {745.7 \hbox{ W} \over 1 \hbox{ HP}} = 186,425 \hbox{ W} = 186.425 \hbox{ kW}$$
