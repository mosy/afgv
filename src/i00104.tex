An oil refinery processes 200,000 barrels of oil per day.  Given the equivalence of 42 gallons = 1 barrel (petroleum), how many gallons per minute is this?  Be sure to show how you performed the conversion.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

200,000 barrels/day = 5833.33 gallons/minute

\vskip 10pt

In this problem we must convert {\it two} different units of measurement in the given quantity: convert barrels into gallons and also convert days into minutes.  We may do both conversions using unity fractions, expressed in one long calculation as such:

$${200,000 \hbox{ bbl} \over 1 \hbox{ day}} \times {42 \hbox{ gal} \over 1 \hbox{ bbl}} \times {1 \hbox{ day} \over 24 \hbox{ hrs}} \times {1 \hbox{ hr} \over 60 \hbox{ min}}$$

Note how all the unity fractions are properly arranged to cancel out the units we don't wish to keep, and replace them with units we do.  Note also how the units do not have to be in fractions immediately next to one another in order to cancel.  The unit of ``day,'' for example, in the top of the third fraction cancels with the unit of ``day'' in the bottom of the first fraction even though those two fractions are not adjacent to one another.
