Albert Einstein determined that mass and energy were equivalent, and related the two in his famous equation $E = mc^2$, where $E$ is energy in units of joules, $m$ is mass in kilograms, and $c$ is the velocity of light in meters per second (3 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ meters per second).

The first atomic bomb used in war was a 10-kiloton device dropped on the city of Hiroshima, Japan.  ``10 kiloton'' means the equivalent energy release of 10,000 tons of TNT chemical explosive.  1 ton equivalent of TNT is equal to 4.184 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ joules of energy.  Based on these figures, how much mass was converted into energy with the detonation of the world's first atomic weapon?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

10 kilotons TNT = 0.00046489 kilograms = 0.46489 grams

\vskip 10pt

Solving this problem requires two major steps: first, converting the unit of kilotons' explosive potential into joules of energy, then using Einstein's famous formula to convert that quantity of energy into mass.  First, the kiloton/joules conversion:

$${10,000 \hbox{ tons TNT} \over 1} \times {4.184 \times 10^9 \hbox{ J} \over 1 \hbox{ ton TNT}} = 4.184 \times 10^{13} \hbox{ J}$$

Now that we have a figure for the amount of energy released in that explosion, we manipulate Einstein's equation to solve for mass, then plug that figure in to solve for mass in units of kilograms.  Note that $c$ (the speed of light) is expressed in units of meters per second:

$$E = mc^2$$

$$m = {E \over c^2}$$

$$m = {{4.184 \times 10^{13} \hbox{ J}} \over \left({3 \times 10^8 \hbox{ m/s}}\right)^2} = 0.00046489 \hbox{ kg} = 0.46489 \hbox{ g}$$
