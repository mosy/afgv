Ammonium sulfate, having the chemical formula (NH$_{4}$)$_{2}$SO$_{4}$, may be produced from ammonia (NH$_{3}$), sulfur dioxide (SO$_{2}$), water (H$_{2}$O), and oxygen (O$_{2}$) by the following (unbalanced) chemical reaction:

$$\hbox{NH}_3 + \hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{O}_2 \to (\hbox{NH}_4)_2\hbox{SO}_4$$

Balance this chemical reaction, showing all the reactants and reaction products in their proper proportions.
