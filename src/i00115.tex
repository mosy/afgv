Participation is always an important factor in student success, both in being able to learn enough to pass the assessments given in a course, and also to fulfill certain policy expectations.  It is vital that students learn to manage their time and life outside of school so that their time in school is well-spent.  This carries over to work ethic and the ability to contribute fully on the job.  Your instructor's duty is to prepare you for the rigors of the workplace as instrument technicians, and the policies of the courses are set up to reflect this reality.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Each student is allowed a certain number of hours absence time per quarter (refer to the syllabus for the exact number!), to be used for absences of any reason.  Absences exceeding this number of hours will result in grade deductions (refer to the syllabus to see how severe!).  Unused absence hours may be donated by students to their classmates at the end of each quarter to help out fellow students in need.
