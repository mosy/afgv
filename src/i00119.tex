During the manufacture of steel from iron, an important chemical process called {\it pickling} uses hydrochloric acid to remove iron oxides.  The following (unbalanced) equations show the reactants (iron oxides, iron, and acid) and products (ferrous chloride and water):

$$\hbox{Fe}_2\hbox{O}_3 + \hbox{Fe} + \hbox{HCl} \to \hbox{FeCl}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$

$$\hbox{Fe}_3\hbox{O}_4 + \hbox{Fe} + \hbox{HCl} \to \hbox{FeCl}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$

Balance both chemical reactions, showing all the reactants and reaction products in their proper proportions.

$$\hbox{Fe}_2\hbox{O}_3 + \hbox{Fe} + 6\hbox{HCl} \to 3\hbox{FeCl}_2 + 3\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$

$$\hbox{Fe}_3\hbox{O}_4 + \hbox{Fe} + 8\hbox{HCl} \to 4\hbox{FeCl}_2 + 4\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$
