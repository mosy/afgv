You are required to prepare for the classroom (theory) session by completing any reading assignments and/or attempting to answer worksheet questions assigned for each day, before arriving to class.  This necessarily involves substantial independent research and problem-solving on your part.

What should you do if you encounter a question that completely mystifies you, and you have no idea how to answer it?  By the same token, what should you do if you encounter a section of the required reading that you just can't seem to understand?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If you find yourself completely lost on a question or on a portion of the assigned reading despite having exhausted all available study time before class, you should highlight these specific points in your notes and seek help immediately at the beginning of class time.  Chances are, you won't be the only person with that same question, and your query at the beginning of class will help others too!
