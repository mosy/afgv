Examine the diagram for a Foxboro model 139PP pneumatic pressure repeater, then identify multiple faults which could cause this instrument to:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Output {\it less} pressure than it should (i.e. less pneumatic signal pressure than process fluid pressure)
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Output {\it more} pressure than it should (i.e. more pneumatic signal pressure than process fluid pressure)
\end{itemize}

For each of your identified faults, explain {\it why} the pneumatic output signal pressure will be incorrect, and also identify how to correct the problem.

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Describe a practical application for this instrument.
\item{} Explain how it is possible to determine from the cross-sectional diagram which portions of the mechanism move and which portions are stationary.
\item{} Is this a ``bleeding'' or a ``non-bleeding'' pneumatic mechanism?
\item{} Identify and explain how the sensing diaphragm of this instrument is protected from damage against modest process over-pressure events.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Reasons for the output pressure to be too low:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Air supply pressure too low
\item{} Supply air port clogged
\item{} Leak in output signal tube
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Reasons for the output pressure to be too high:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Air supply pressure much too high
\item{} Vent air port clogged
\item{} Control valve plug not fully seating (shutting off)
\item{} Suppression spring too compressed
\end{itemize}
