%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Advantages of GWR over non-contact: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Ability to sense liquid-liquid interfaces
\item{} Better rejection of false signals from reflections off in-tank structures
\item{} Minimal RF radiation (doesn't require FCC permit on plastic tanks)
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Advantages of non-contact over GWR: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Better corrosion resistance
\item{} No problems from material ``hanging up'' on a probe
\item{} Generally easier installation
\item{} Generally easier calibration
\end{itemize}
