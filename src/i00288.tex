Examine this closed-loop trend from a liquid flow-control process:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00288x01.eps}$$

Identify whether you think this is a {\it P-only}, {\it I-only}, {\it P+I}, {\it P+D}, or full {\it PID} controller, based on the trends shown here.

\vskip 10pt

Also, identify whether this is a {\it direct-acting} or a {\it reverse-acting} controller.

\vskip 10pt

Finally, identify the problem this loop has, explaining how you can tell from the trends.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\bf 2 points:} This is a {\bf P+I} controller (no derivative action).  

\vskip 10pt

{\bf 2 points:} The controller is configured for {\bf reverse} action.

\vskip 10pt

{\bf 2 points:} The problem is a sticky control valve

\vskip 10pt

{\bf 4 points:} We can identify this problem by how long the PV remains away from SP despite the controller's integral action winding down.
