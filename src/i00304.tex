One form of non-contact level switch utilizes nuclear radiation to sense the absence or presence of level within a vessel, either liquid or solid.  Briefly explain how these level switches work.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Some nuclear level switches work by sensing the blockage of radiation due to process level, others by the ``backscattering'' (reflection) of radiation by the process level.  Delayed coker drum level detection (in the oil refining industry) is one notable application of the latter technique, where hydrocarbons' property of reflecting neutron radiation more than other substances is the primary detection characteristic.
