The following level switch does not work as it should.  When the water level reaches the probes, the light bulb does not turn on.  

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00306x01.eps}$$

An electrician has already taken a voltmeter and measured 118 volts AC between points {\bf D} and {\bf G} while the water was high enough to contact the probes.  Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.

Finally, identify the {\it next} diagnostic test or measurement you would make on this system.  Explain how the result(s) of this next test or measurement help further identify the location and/or nature of the fault.

Some possible faults not listed in the table include:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Open relay switch contact
\item{} Open wire between points D and F
\item{} Open wire(s) leading to probe(s)
\item{} Wrong liquid in the process vessel
\end{itemize}

Subsequent diagnostic tests might include voltmeter measurements of AC voltage at the relay's primary and/or secondary terminals.





\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Virtual Troubleshooting} \vrule} \hrule}

This question is a good candidate for a ``Virtual Troubleshooting'' exercise.  Presenting the diagram to students, you first imagine in your own mind a particular fault in the system.  Then, you present one or more symptoms of that fault (something noticeable by an operator or other user of the system).  Students then propose various diagnostic tests to perform on this system to identify the nature and location of the fault, as though they were technicians trying to troubleshoot the problem.  Your job is to tell them what the result(s) would be for each of the proposed diagnostic tests, documenting those results where all the students can see.

During and after the exercise, it is good to ask students follow-up questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What does the result of the last diagnostic test tell you about the fault?
\item{} Suppose the results of the last diagnostic test were different.  What then would that result tell you about the fault?
\item{} Is the last diagnostic test the best one we could do?
\item{} What would be the ideal order of tests, to diagnose the problem in as few steps as possible?
\end{itemize}
