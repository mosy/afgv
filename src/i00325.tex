Dow Chemical patented a process for converting olefinic hydrocarbons (molecules having the general formula C$_{n}$H$_{2n}$) into alcohols by combination with water:

$$\hbox{C}_n\hbox{H}_{2n} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{C}_n\hbox{H}_{2n+2}\hbox{O}$$

Re-write this chemical reaction showing the conversion of ethylene to ethanol, then once again showing the conversion of propylene to isopropanol.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
Ethylene to ethanol:

$$\hbox{C}_2\hbox{H}_{4} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{C}_2\hbox{H}_{6}\hbox{O}$$

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
Propylene to isopropanol:

$$\hbox{C}_3\hbox{H}_{6} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \to \hbox{C}_3\hbox{H}_{8}\hbox{O}$$
