A block of iron and a block of copper are both heated to 200$^{o}$ F in an oven, then placed on a wooden table to cool down to room temperature.  Assuming all other factors being equal (mass, surface area, etc.), which block will cool at a faster rate?  Why??

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The copper block will cool at a faster rate, because copper has less specific heat than iron, meaning that any given amount of heat energy lost will decrease its temperature more than it will iron for the same amount of heat energy loss.  Another way of saying this is that the copper contains less heat energy than the iron, even though they both start out at the same temperature.

$c_{Cu}$ = 0.093 cal/g$\cdot ^{o}$C

\vskip 10pt

$c_{Fe}$ = 0.113 cal/g$\cdot ^{o}$C
