Suppose a process vessel containing only H$_{2}$O is equipped with both a temperature indicator and a pressure indicator.  Consult a {\it steam table} to determine whether the conditions within this vessel are {\it water only}, {\it water and steam mixed}, or {\it steam only}:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $T$ = 501 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 810 PSIG 
\item{} $T$ = 250 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 75 PSIG 
\item{} $T$ = 690 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 1886 PSIG 
\item{} $T$ = 369 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 550 PSIG 
\item{} $T$ = 274 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 30 PSIG 
\item{} $T$ = 471 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 405 PSIG 
\end{itemize}

If you determine the process condition to be {\it steam only}, calculate the amount of superheat (i.e. the number of degrees F that the steam is heated beyond the boiling temperature).

Hint: the {\it Socratic Instrumentation} website contains a page where you may download public-domain textbooks, one of which is a set of steam tables published in 1920.  The {\it Fisher Control Valve Handbook} also has a (less comprehensive) set of steam tables in the Appendix section.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Plot where each of these temperature/pressure points falls on a {\it phase diagram} for ice, water, and steam.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\bf Partial answer:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $T$ = 501 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 810 PSIG :
\item{} $T$ = 250 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 75 PSIG : {\bf water only}
\item{} $T$ = 690 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 1886 PSIG : {\bf steam only}, approximately {\bf 61 deg F} superheat
\item{} $T$ = 369 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 550 PSIG :
\item{} $T$ = 274 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 30 PSIG  : {\bf water and steam mixed}
\item{} $T$ = 471 $^{o}$F and $P$ = 405 PSIG : 
\end{itemize}
