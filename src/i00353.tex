Rank the following transitions according to the amount of heat energy input required:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} To heat a pound of water from 60$^{o}$ F to 65$^{o}$ F. 
\item{} To boil a pound of water completely into steam (warming it from 211$^{o}$ F to 213$^{o}$ F). 
\item{} To melt a pound of ice completely into water (warming it from 31$^{o}$ F to 33$^{o}$ F). 
\end{itemize}


\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Which of these transitions involves {\it sensible heat} and which involve {\it latent heat}?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In order of most heat required to least heat required:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} To boil a pound of water completely into steam (warming it from 211$^{o}$ F to 213$^{o}$ F). 
\item{} To melt a pound of ice completely into water (warming it from 31$^{o}$ F to 33$^{o}$ F). 
\item{} To heat a pound of water from 60$^{o}$ F to 65$^{o}$ F. 
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} To boil a pound of water completely into steam at 212$^{o}$ F (approximately 970 BTU required). 
\item{} To melt a pound of ice completely into water at 32$^{o}$ F (approximately 144 BTU required). 
\item{} To heat a pound of water from 60$^{o}$ F to 65$^{o}$ F (approximately 5 BTU required). 
\end{itemize}

$$L_{vaporization} = 970 \hbox{ BTU/lbm for water}$$

$$L_{fusion} = 144 \hbox{ BTU/lbm for water}$$

$$c_{water} = 1 \hbox{ BTU/lbm} \cdot \hbox{F}^{o}$$

$$c_{steam} = 0.48 \hbox{ BTU/lbm} \cdot \hbox{F}^{o}$$

$$c_{ice} = 0.5 \hbox{ BTU/lbm} \cdot \hbox{F}^{o}$$
