\begin{itemize}
\item{} Explain why the TSH uses a {\it normally-open} contact instead of a {\it normally-closed} contact.
\item{} Explain why the TSL uses a {\it normally-closed} contact instead of a {\it normally-open} contact.
\item{} Based on what we see in this diagram, determine whether the electric solenoid valve allows cooling water to flow when energized, or when de-energized.
\item{} What do the designations ``L1'' and ``L2'' refer to in ladder-logic electrical diagrams?
\item{} Suppose switch TSL has a trip setting of 105 $^{o}$F (falling) and a deadband value of 2 $^{o}$F.  Explain how this switch will respond to a rising and falling temperature.
\item{} Suppose we wished to have switch TSHH activate {\it two} different alarm lights instead of just one.  Modify the circuit diagram accordingly.
