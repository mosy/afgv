Suppose you are sent to troubleshoot a positive displacement flowmeter equipped with a pulse-contact output (rated at one pulse per 20 gallons), driving an electronic counter circuit to keep track of total water flow through the flowmeter over time.  The counter requires a {\it pulsing} signal to count up (i.e. a steady ``low'' or steady ``high'' signal will not result in an incrementing count value), and for some reason it is not counting as it should even though we know there is actually water flow going through the flowmeter.  Using a digital multimeter, you measure a constant 0 volts between terminals {\bf E} and {\bf G} while waiting long enough for the flowmeter switch to cycle (pulse) at least once:

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.
