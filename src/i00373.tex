It is a fundamental principle of thermocouple circuits that the voltage output by a junction will be the same as for a collection of isothermal (``same-temperature'') junctions beginning and ending with the same metal types:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00373x01.eps}$$

In other words, a junction comprised of metal {\bf A} joining together with metal {\bf B} will produce the same voltage as a collection of isothermal, series junctions {\bf A}-{\bf C}, {\bf C}-{\bf D}, {\bf D}-{\bf E}, and {\bf E}-{\bf B}.  This is sometimes referred to as the Law of Intermediate metals.  

Apply this equivalence principle to the following circuit, simplifying it so as to reduce the number of total junctions to an absolute minimum (assume that you can make the voltmeter wires out of any metal type you desire, so long as they're both the same):

Would the thermocouple work the same if we got rid of the metal {\bf B} segment at the terminal block?  Explain why or why not.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Making both voltmeter wires out of metal {\bf B} allows this simplification of junctions:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00373x03.eps}$$

Getting rid of metal {\bf B} completely works just as well!  Now the {\bf A-C} and {\bf B-C} junctions act as a single reference junction, because they are held at the same temperature by the thermal conductivity of the terminal block:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Both voltmeter wires could have been made out of metal {\bf A} with the same degree of simplicity in the final circuit.  In either case, the simplified circuit contains only two dissimilar-metal junctions:
