This water filter level control system seems to be ``cycling'' for some reason, with the filter's level oscillating above and below setpoint over time.  The operators call you and another technician to diagnose the problem:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00395x01.eps}$$

The technician working with you decides to place the LIC in manual mode and re-examine the level trend.  For each of the possible results following the technician's test, identify {\bf one} possible problem that could cause it.  Be as specific as you can when describing the possible problems:

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf Possible result 1} -- {\it The level cycling ceases} -- Identify one specific problem that could cause this:

\vskip 100pt

\noindent
{\bf Possible result 2} -- {\it The level cycling continues:} -- Identify one specific problem that could cause this:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Award 5 points for providing {\it one} specific problem per test result.

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf Possible result 1} -- {\it The level cycling ceases:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} One specific problem that could cause this: 
\begin{itemize}

\item{} Too much integral action in LIC
\item{} Too much derivative action in LIC
\item{} LT sending unstable current signals
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\bf Possible result 2} -- {\it The level cycling continues:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} One specific problem that could cause this:
\begin{itemize}

\item{} Too much integral action in FIC
\item{} Valve stiction (hysteresis)
\item{} Unstable valve positioner
\item{} Cyclic load on the process
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
