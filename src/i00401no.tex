No reference junction compensation is needed at the indicator, because no reference junction exists there.  In effect, the thermocouple at $T_2$ serves as a ``reference'' junction to the thermocouple at $T_1$.

A practical application for a differential thermocouple is in a solar heating system for a house.  During the day time, solar energy will ensure that the collector is at a greater temperature than the house which it warms.  At night, however, when the sun is not shining, the collector will be colder than the house.  In this state, you do {\it not} want the circulating pump (or blower) to run, for that would transfer heat out of the warm house and dissipate it through the cold collector.  A differential thermocouple could tell you (by the polarity of its voltage) which was warmer: the collector or the house.  Then, an op-amp comparator circuit could disable the circulating pump to prevent heat loss through the collector at night.
