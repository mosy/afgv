A 100 $\Omega$ platinum RTD with an alpha ($\alpha$) of 0.00385 has a measured resistance of 98 $\Omega$.  Calculate its temperature, expressing your answer both in degrees C and degrees F.

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Two common $\alpha$ values for platinum RTDs are 0.00385 and 0.00392.  Which of these is sometimes referred to as the ``European'' value and which as the ``American'' value?  Are these labels accurate?
\end{itemize}
