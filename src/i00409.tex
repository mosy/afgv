Er termperatur/resistans overføringsfunksjonen mer eller mindre lineær for en RTD i forhold til et termoelement? Hva har dette å si for valg av temperaturføler?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

RTDs are more linear than thermocouples.  This means that RTDs tend to be more precise within their rated temperature ranges than thermocouples within their rated temperature ranges when interpreted by a linear transmitter circuit, all other factors being equal. 

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Moral of the story: choose RTDs over thermocouples for applications requiring high accuracy.
