Is the temperature/resistance transfer function of an RTD more or less linear than the temperature/voltage transfer function of a thermocouple?  What bearing does this have on the decision to choose a thermocouple versus an RTD for a temperature measurement application?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

RTDs are more linear than thermocouples.  This means that RTDs tend to be more precise within their rated temperature ranges than thermocouples within their rated temperature ranges when interpreted by a linear transmitter circuit, all other factors being equal.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Moral of the story: choose RTDs over thermocouples for applications requiring high accuracy.
