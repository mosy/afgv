The Stefan-Boltzmann Law of radiated energy tells us that the rate of heat lost by radiant emission from a hot object is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature:

$${dQ \over dt} = e \sigma A T^4$$

\noindent
Where,

$dQ \over dt$ = Radiant heat loss rate, in watts (W)

$e$ = Emissivity factor, unitless

$\sigma$ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 $\times$ $10^{-8}$ W / m$^{2}$ $\cdot$ K$^{4}$)

$A$ = Surface area, in square meters (m$^{2}$)

$T$ = Absolute temperature, Kelvin (K)

\vskip 10pt

Algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for $T$ in terms of all the other variables.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$T = \root 4 \of {\left({dQ \over dt}\right) \over {e \sigma A}}$$
