A laborer working on the top of a building uses a hoist to lift 20 gallons of water in a bucket to the top of a building:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00428x01.eps}$$

The rope is counterweighted with a mass equal to that of the bucket (empty), so that the bucket's weight does not have to be lifted, only the water inside the bucket.  Assuming a vertical lift distance of 31 feet, how much work does the laborer do in lifting the water up?   Please express your answer in both English and metric units of work.

\vskip 10pt

Suppose it takes laborer ``A'' one minute to lift the 20-gallon bucket of water up 31 feet to the top of the building.  A few hours later, laborer ``B'' does the same thing, but in less time: 40 seconds.  Which laborer performs more work in lifting 20 gallons of water to the roof?

\vskip 10pt

Now suppose someone smart decides to equip the hoist with an electric motor, so that the laborers do not have to exert so much effort in lifting water to the roof.  If the motor exerts 1.5 horsepower in lifting the 20 gallons of water to the roof, how long will it take to lift it the 31 foot vertical distance?

How long would it take a 1.5 horsepower {\it pump} to lift 20 gallons of water to the same height?

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: if we were to drop the 20-gallon bucket full of water off the roof, how fast would it be falling just before it hit the ground?  Disregard the effects of air friction on the bucket's free-fall.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Work done in lifting the bucket manually: 5174.15 ft-lb, or 7015.24 J.  Laborer ``A'' does the exact same amount of work as laborer ``B,'' but their {\it power} output is not the same.

\vskip 10pt

Time required for electric hoist to lift the 20 gallon bucket = 6.269 seconds.  

Time required for electric pump to lift 20 gallons of water to the roof = 6.269 seconds.

\vskip 10pt

Answer to challenge question: 44.54 ft/s (down)
