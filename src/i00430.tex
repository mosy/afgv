Sam climbs a 130 foot tower with an 8 pound (0.25 slug) textbook.  Tony climbs the same tower with a 5 pound (0.16 slug) textbook.  Both Sam and Tony drop their textbooks from the top of the tower at exactly the same moment in time.  Neglecting the effects of air friction on the books' free-fall, calculate the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Work done by Sam in lifting his textbook = 
\item{} Kinetic energy of Sam's textbook just before it hits the ground =
\item{} Velocity of Sam's textbook just before it hits the ground =
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Work done by Tony in lifting his textbook = 
\item{} Kinetic energy of Tony's textbook just before it hits the ground =
\item{} Velocity of Tony's textbook just before it hits the ground =
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Work done by Sam in lifting his textbook = 1040 ft-lb
\item{} Kinetic energy of Sam's textbook just before it hits the ground = 1040 ft-lb
\item{} Velocity of Sam's textbook just before it hits the ground = 91.2 ft/s
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Work done by Tony in lifting his textbook = 650 ft-lb
\item{} Kinetic energy of Tony's textbook just before it hits the ground = 650 ft-lb
\item{} Velocity of Tony's textbook just before it hits the ground = 91.2 ft/s
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Knowing that kinetic energy just before the book hits the ground should be equal to potential energy when released (assuming zero energy loss due to air friction), we may solve for $v$ quite easily:

$$E_k = {1 \over 2}mv^2 \hbox{\hskip 100pt} E_p = mgh$$

$${1 \over 2}mv^2 = mgh$$

$${1 \over 2}v^2 = gh$$

$$v^2 = 2gh$$

$$v = \sqrt{2gh}$$
