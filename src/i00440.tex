As best as possible, define {\it Reynolds number} for a fluid flow using your own words.

\vskip 10pt

Regn ut reynolds nummer for 32 liter vann per sekund (at 20$^{o}$ C) som strømmer i et rør med en diameter på 22 cm.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The {\it Reynolds number} for a fluid flow is the ratio of a fluid's inertial (motion) forces as compared to its friction (viscous) forces.

\vskip 30pt
 
To calculate Reynolds number given metric units:

$$\hbox{Re} = {{D \overline{V} \rho} \over \mu}$$

\noindent
Where,

Re = Reynolds number (unitless)

$D$ = Diameter of pipe, in meters (m)

$\overline{V}$ = Average velocity of fluid, in meters per second (m/s)

$\rho$ = Mass density of fluid, in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m$^{3}$)

$\mu$ = Absolute viscosity of fluid, in Pascal-seconds (Pa $\cdot$ s)

\vskip 60pt \goodbreak

Re = 184903

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Reynolds number is an expression of a flow stream's kinetic action versus dissipative resistance.  It is a unitless number, and a very important one as far as turbulence is concerned.
