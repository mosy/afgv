Calculate the pressure at the discharge end of this pipe ($P_2$), assuming water as the fluid (with a mass density $\rho$ = 1.951 slugs/ft$^{3}$), 32.2 ft/s$^{2}$ as the acceleration of gravity ($g$), and frictionless flow (no pressure loss due to friction):

{\bf Bernoulli's equation:}

$$z_1 \rho g + {v_1^2 \rho \over 2} + P_1 = z_2 \rho g + {v_2^2 \rho \over 2} + P_2$$

$P_2$ = 473.7 lb/ft$^{2}$

It is tempting to alter Bernoulli's Equation to handle measurements in inches rather than feet (especially the annoying unit of pressure measurement: pounds per square {\it foot}, rather than PSI).  However, caution must be exercised when attempting this, because there is more to it than simply converting feet into inches every place you see ``ft'' in the equation.

$$z_1 \rho g + {v_1^2 \rho \over 2} + P_1 = z_2 \rho g + {v_2^2 \rho \over 2} + P_2$$

There is the unit of ``feet'' lurking inside the unit of ``slugs'' which must also be accounted for.  Here is the standard weight-mass-gravity equation relating slugs to pounds:

$$W = mg$$

$$[\hbox{lb}] = [\hbox{slug}] \left[ \hbox{ft} \over \hbox{s}^2 \right]$$

If we re-write the unit analysis equation to show slugs as a compound unit, we see that ``feet'' lurks within:

$$[\hbox{lb}] = \left[{\hbox{lb} \cdot \hbox{s}^2} \over \hbox{ft}\right] \left[ \hbox{ft} \over \hbox{s}^2 \right]$$

Thus, expressing $g$ in inches per second squared would require us to invent a new unit of mass (lb $\cdot$ s$^{2}$ per in) instead of slugs (lb $\cdot$ s$^{2}$ per ft).
