%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Any industrial example of accumulated quantities (over time) or of calculating the incremental product as in work calculations.  Examples include but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Fluid or solids flow totalization
\item{} ``I'' action in a PID controller
\end{itemize}

Award only half-credit if the example is not industrial in nature (e.g. calculating the work done in drawing a bow).  Award no credit if the example is not quantitative (i.e. if it lacks number values).
