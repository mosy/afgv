Also, comment on whether or not Bernoulli's equation could be used to compare the suction and discharge pressures of the pump, being that those two pressures (145 and 302 PSI) are measured on the same size pipe, with the same flow rate, and very similar elevations (heights).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$P_1$ = 296.77 PSI \hskip 30pt $P_2$ = 293.27 PSI

\vskip 10pt

Bernoulli's equation assumes no gain or loss of energy between the two locations compared, and so it {\it cannot} be used to contrast the pump's suction and discharge pressures.  The pump is a machine that adds energy to the fluid going through it, and so the assumption of equal (total) energy between the incoming and outgoing flow streams is not correct.
