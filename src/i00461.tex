Examine this schematic of a temperature control system for a steam-heated exchanger:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00461x01.eps}$$

Determine the effect on the control system's regulation of temperature inside the vessel if the thermocouple fails open and causes the temperature transmitter to output a high signal all the time (i.e. TT output $>$ 20 mA).  Assume all loop components are properly configured, that the controller is well-tuned, and that a significant amount of time has passed since the thermocouple failure.  Compare these conditions with what they were before the failure:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Control valve will: {\it open up} further, {\it close down} more, or {\it remain in the same position} 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Process temperature will: {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it remain the same} as before
\end{itemize}
