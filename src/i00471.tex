Suppose you are configuring a control system's analog input function block to receive the 4-20 mA signal from a temperature transmitter ranged 150 $^{o}$F to 350 $^{o}$F.  In order to properly ``scale'' this milliamp signal into a measurement value expressed in units of degrees Fahrenheit, the analog input function block requires a linear formula in the form $y = mx + b$ to relate milliamps of signal to degrees Fahrenheit of temperature.

\vskip 10pt

Write such a formula, where $x$ is milliamps (range = 4 to 20) and $y$ is degrees Fahrenheit (range = 150 to 350):

\vskip 10pt

$y =$

\vskip 20pt

Now suppose you are faced with a slightly different challenge, where the $x$ value read by the controller's analog input block comes from a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter with a full-scale range of 0.0 to 21.5 milliamps.  The temperature transmitter is still ranged 150 $^{o}$F to 350 $^{o}$F, 4 to 20 mA.  Write a scaling formula where $x$ is the decimal ``count'' value coming from the ADC and $y$ is in degrees Fahrenheit (range = 150 to 350):

\vskip 10pt

$y =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

First scenario (mA to deg F):

$$y = {200 \over 16}x + 100 \hskip 50pt y = 12.5x + 100$$

\vskip 10pt

Second scenario (ADC counts to deg F):

$$y = {200 \over 48770}x + 100 \hskip 50pt = 0.004101x + 100 \hskip 50pt = {x \over 243.85} + 100$$
