The following screenshot shows the configuration window for an analog input on a Delta DSC-1280 DDC building automation controller:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00484x01.eps}$$

Based on the parameters you see in this configuration window, how many bits does the analog-digital converter inside the DDC controller use?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If 87.7\% of range yields a ADC count value of 3589, then 100\% must yield a count value of 4092.  The closest count value for any number of ADC bits is 4096, for a 12-bit converter.  It is safe to say, then, that this ADC is 12-bit.

\vskip 10pt

Another way to tell this is a 12-bit ADC is by calculating from the given resolution value of 0.02442 \%.  This means each bit is worth 0.0002442 as a per unit value.  The reciprocal of this per unit value will be the total number of counts:

$${1 \over 0.0002442} = 4095 \hbox{ counts}$$
