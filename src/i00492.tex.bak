An important numerical constant related to the von K\'arm\'an effect is the {\it Strouhal number}.  Explain what this number means, and why its constant (unchanging) value is important to flow-measuring instruments based on the von K\'arm\'an effect.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The Strouhal number (approximately equal to 0.17) is the ratio of a blunt object's width to the distance between successive fluid vortices spilling off of the side of that object.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In essence, the Strouhal number tells us that the {\it wavelength} of vortex ``waves'' is always constant given a bluff body of constant width.  Therefore, the frequency of these waves is directly proportional to the velocity of the fluid (and thus the volumetric flow rate in a pipe of constant cross-sectional area).
