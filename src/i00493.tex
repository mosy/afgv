Suppose a stream of water flowing through a 10-inch diameter pipe passes by a 1-inch-wide blunt object installed in the middle of that pipe, and generates a series of von K\'arm\'an vortices having a frequency of 4.167 Hz.  Calculate the flow rate through the pipe in gallons per minute (GPM).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Q$ = 500.04 GPM

\vskip 10pt

We may derive an exact formula by using a {\it proportionality factor} ($k$) and the specific set of values used to answer the quantitative question.  We know that flow rate will be proportional to the product of frequency, bluff body width, and the square of pipe diameter\footnote{$^{1}$}{Using qualitative analysis, we can tell that $Q$ increases proportionally with increases in $f$ and with increases in $w$.  We can also tell that $Q$ increases proportionally with the {\it square} of increases in $D$.  Just imagine doubling each of these variables, one at a time (while holding the others constant) and determine the effect on $Q$.}:

$$Q \propto f w D^2$$

We may express this as an exact equation by adding a factor $k$:

$$Q = k f w D^2$$

Solving for $k$:

$$k = {Q \over {f w D^2}}$$

$$k = {500.04 \over {(4.167)(1)(10)^2}} = 1.2$$

Therefore,

$$Q = 1.2 f w D^2$$

\noindent
Where,

$Q$ = Flow rate, in gallons per minute (GPM)

$f$ = Vortex shedding frequency, in Hertz (Hz)

$w$ = Bluff body width, in inches (in)

$D$ = Diameter of pipe, in inches (in)

\vskip 10pt

One really neat advantage of calculating $k$ in this manner is that it incorporates all the necessary unit conversions performed in the original solution of $Q = 500.04$ GPM.  Now, all we do is enter $f$ in Hertz, $w$ in inches, and $D$ in inches, and we automatically get an answer for $Q$ in units of gallons per minute.
