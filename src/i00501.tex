Research the necessary upstream and downstream straight-pipe requirements for vortex and turbine meters, and identify how these requirements compare against the typical requirements of orifice plates.  For review's sake, why do we need a certain minimum length of straight pipe length upstream and downstream of a flow-measuring device?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Vortex meter and turbine meter both: 15 to 50 pipe diameters upstream; 5 pipe diameters downstream.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The straight-run piping requirements for vortex and turbine meters are comparable to that of orifice plates.
