A level transmitter needs to be installed in a process where the liquid density happens to change over time (anywhere from 55 lb/ft$^{3}$ to 68 lb/ft$^{3}$, unpredictably) but the vapor density remains constant.  Determine whether or not each of the following level-sensing instruments would be appropriate for this application (i.e. whether or not each technology would yield reliable and reasonably accurate measurements of process level):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Ultrasonic (top-mounted): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Hydrostatic (bubble tube): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Hydrostatic (remote seals): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\end{itemize}
