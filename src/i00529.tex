Ultrasonic flowmeters exhibit special advantages and disadvantages when compared to other flow-measuring technologies.  For each of the following strengths and weaknesses, explain {\it why} it is this way for an ultrasonic flowmeter:

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Strengths:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} May be attached to the {\it outside} of a pipe
\item{} Relatively inexpensive on large pipes
\item{} Work on liquids, gases, and some vapors
\item{} Output is linearly related to volumetric flow rate -- no square root characterization required
\item{} Good rangeability
\item{} Bidirectional measurement possible
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Weaknesses:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Calibration varies with speed of sound in fluid for some types (which?)
\item{} Efficiently coupling sensors to pipe can be challenging
\item{} May require long straight-pipe lengths to condition flow
\item{} May suffer false readings from sound waves ``ringing around the pipe'' instead of going through the fluid
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

{\bf Strengths:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} May be attached to the {\it outside} of a pipe -- {\it merely need to conduct sound waves through the fluid to measure its velocity}
\item{} Relatively inexpensive on large pipes -- {\it transducer size does not scale with pipe size, making small transducers useful on huge pipes}
\item{} Work on liquids, gases, and some vapors -- {\it any fluid transmitting sound is fair game}
\item{} Output is linearly related to volumetric flow rate -- no square root characterization required -- {\it Doppler frequency shift is linear with velocity; so is transit time difference}
\item{} Good rangeability -- {\it linear response means good turndown}
\item{} Bidirectional measurement possible -- {\it Doppler shift merely changes sign with direction; ditto for transit-time differences}
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Weaknesses:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Calibration varies with speed of sound in fluid for some types (which?) -- {\it Doppler dependent on $c$; transit-time is not}
\item{} Efficiently coupling sensors to pipe can be challenging -- {\it need good acoustic coupling to ensure audio signal integrity}
\item{} May require long straight-pipe lengths to condition flow -- {\it since chord picks up on velocity of fluid in one path only, swirl and eddies can hamper accuracy}
\item{} May suffer false readings from sound waves ``ringing around the pipe'' instead of going through the fluid -- {\it sound waves may conduct through the pipe walls rather than through the fluid, especially with clamp-on flowmeter types}
\end{itemize}
