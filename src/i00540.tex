Suppose an RF signal cable receives 230 milliwatts of RF power at one end, but conveys only 89 milliwatts of RF power to its far end.  Express each of these power figures in dBm, and then express the power loss of this cable in dB.

\vskip 10pt

Also, calculate the loss of the cable in decibels per foot, assuming it is 170 feet long.

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Estimate these decibel values by first rounding the power ratio to the nearest product of 10 and/or 2, then applying the equivalence of 10 dB to a 10-fold ratio and 3 dB to a 2-fold ratio.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$P_{in}$ = 230 mW = 23.617 dBm

\vskip 10pt

$P_{out}$ = 89 mW = 19.494 dBm

\vskip 10pt

Cable loss = $-4.123$ dB 

\vskip 10pt

Cable loss = $-0.02426$ dB per foot
