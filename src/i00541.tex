In this question, you will be asked to research several different types of flowmeters and determine their specifications with regard to piping geometry (minimum upstream and downstream straight-pipe lengths), minimum or maximum Reynolds number, fluid types, and any other special advantages or disadvantages.  This will require a significant amount of research on your part, but the exercise is well worth the effort, because it will educate you on the proper applications of each flowmeter type.  This will enable you to make educated decisions on the type of flowmeter to choose for a wide range of fluid flow measurement applications.

Shown here is the standard ``form'' you should use in researching each flowmeter type:
