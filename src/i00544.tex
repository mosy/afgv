There are several different types of flow meter devices broadly grouped under the classification of {\it positive displacement}.  Describe the operational principle of a positive displacement flowmeter.  Also, describe what physical properties of the fluid stream affect a positive displacement flowmeter's calibration.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\it Positive displacement} flowmeters of all types use mechanisms to move specific volumes of fluid through with each rotation or other mechanism cycle.  Many positive displacement meters resemble pump mechanisms in design.

Because positive displacement meters move specified volumes of fluid through them per cycle, they are immune to changes in viscosity, density, and other fluid parameters.  However, it must be understood that the quantity being measured is actual volume, not {\it standardized} volume units.  In other words, a positive displacement gas flowmeter inherently measures in units such as cubic feet per minute (CFM), not standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM).
