What is a flow {\it prover}, and why is it periodically necessary to use one to re-calibrate positive-displacement flowmeters?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A ``prover'' is a precision device used to measure a flow rate for a short period of time.  Provers are typically of the piston-and-cylinder design, measuring flow rate by timing how long it takes the piston to travel a certain distance (i.e. displace a certain volume of fluid).

Periodic re-calibration of positive-displacement flowmeters is necessary because they all suffer from internal friction and mechanical wear.
