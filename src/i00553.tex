How many electrons, protons, and neutrons does a single atom of Carbon-12 ($^{12}$C) contain?  (Assume an electrically balanced atom.)

\vskip 10pt

How many electrons, protons, and neutrons does the average atom of gold (Au) contain?  (Assume an electrically balanced atom.)

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

For Carbon-12, ``12'' represents the atom's {\it atomic mass} (sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus).  Since the {\it atomic number} of Carbon is 6, we know there are 6 protons in the nucleus.  Subtracting 6 from 12 leaves us with 6 neutrons in the nucleus as well.  For the atom to be electrically neutral, there must be 6 electrons to balance the 6 protons.

\vskip 10pt

For gold, the average {\it atomic mass} of 197 represents the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.  Since the {\it atomic number} of gold is 79, we know there are 79 protons in the nucleus.  Subtracting 79 from 197 leaves us with 118 neutrons in the nucleus.  For the atom to be electrically neutral, there must be 79 electrons to balance the 79 protons.
