%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The former symbol (H$_{2}$) represents two atoms of hydrogen (H) joined as a pair (a {\it diatomic} molecule).  The latter symbol represents hydrogen with an atomic mass of 2, an isotope of hydrogen known as {\it deuterium}.  In summary, the former symbol denotes a {\it chemical} state, while the latter symbol denotes a {\it nuclear} state.
