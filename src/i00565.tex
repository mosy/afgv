In chemistry, the unit of the {\it mole} is important when quantifying substances.  What exactly is a mole?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A mole is a specific quantity of unit ``entities,'' usually {\it molecules} when used in the context of chemistry.  The SI (Syst\'eme International) definition of the mole is the amount of substance that contains 6.0221367 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ particles or entities.  This very large constant is referred to as {\it Avogadro's number}.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Technically, the definition of the mole is based on the number of atoms in a pure, 12 gram sample of carbon-12.

My definition for Avogadro's number came from {\it Physics for Scientists and Engineers}, Third Edition, by Douglas C. Giancoli.
