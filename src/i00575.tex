{\it Silane} is a flammable and toxic gas (SiH$_{4}$, also called silicon tetrahydride) used widely in silicon semiconductor manufacturing processes.  If a leak develops in a pipe carrying silane, the result is immediate combustion, each molecule of silane gas combining with two molecules of atmospheric oxygen (O$_{2}$).

One of the products of silane + oxygen combustion is water vapor (2 molecules of H$_{2}$O produced for each molecule of silane).  There is only one other combustion product.  Determine what this product is, and how many molecules of it are produced for each molecule of silane gas entering the reaction.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\hbox{SiH}_4 + 2\hbox{O}_2 \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{SiO}_2$$

Silicon dioxide is also known as {\it silica}, and constitutes the mineral {\it quartz}.  This means that a silane fire produces particles of sand in addition to water vapor!
