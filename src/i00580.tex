A common concern in industrial maintenance work is {\it confined spaces}.  Research the definition of a ``confined space'' and explain the potential hazards of working in confined spaces, particularly from the perspective of chemistry.

\vskip 10pt

Next, visit the website of a company selling {\it personal safety gas monitors} used by workers in confined spaces and other industrial sites where certain toxic gases may be present.  Identify some of the common chemical compounds measured by these portable instruments, and also the relative costs of the sensors for each compound.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A good resource to research is BW Technologies, manufacturer of the ``Gas Alert Micro Clip'' personal monitors.  These are very common in industry.  Their website is {\tt http://www.gasmonitors.com}.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Oxygen
\item{} Combustibles (``LEL'')
\item{} CO
\item{} CO$_{2}$
\item{} H$_{2}$S
