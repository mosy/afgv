Suppose you see this label on a chemical storage container:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00589x01.eps}$$

This is a standardized label (National Fire Protection Association -- NFPA) identifying certain hazards of the chemical stored in the container.  Identify what all the markings on this label mean.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This chemical is rated ``moderately hazardous,'' is not flammable, but is unstable if heated.  Additionally, it is corrosive.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The left-hand (blue) diamond rates the substance according to its human health hazard:

\medskip 
\item{} 0 = No hazard
\item{} 1 = Slight hazard
\item{} 2 = Moderately hazardous
\item{} 3 = Extremely hazardous
\item{} 4 = Deadly
\end{itemize} 

\vskip 10pt

The upper (red) diamond rates the substance according to its flammability (flash point):

\medskip 
\item{} 0 = Will not burn
\item{} 1 = Above 200$^{o}$ F
\item{} 2 = Between 100$^{o}$ F and 200$^{o}$ F
\item{} 3 = Between 73$^{o}$ F (room temperature) and 100$^{o}$ F
\item{} 4 = Below 73$^{o}$ F (room temperature)
\end{itemize} 

\vskip 10pt

The right-hand (yellow) diamond rates the substance according to its chemical reactivity:

\medskip 
\item{} 0 = Stable
\item{} 1 = Unstable if heated
\item{} 2 = Violent chemical change, no detonation
\item{} 3 = Shock or heat may detonate
\item{} 4 = May detonate under normal conditions
\end{itemize} 

\vskip 10pt

The lower (white) diamond is a place for abbreviations regarding additional properties.  Standardized abbreviations include:

\medskip 
\item{} ACID = Acidic
\item{} ALK = Alkaline
\item{} COR = Corrosive
\item{} OX = Oxidizer
\item{} P = Polymerization (chemically reacts with itself under certain conditions)
\item{} W (with a line going through it) = Reacts with water
\end{itemize}
