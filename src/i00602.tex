Suppose you need to determine the temperature of a fluid inside a pipe.  Installed in this pipe is a 2-wire 100 $\Omega$ RTD inside a thermowell, not connected to a transmitter or any other circuit.  You happen to have a multimeter with you to measure resistance at the RTD leads.

Touching the two test leads of your multimeter together, you measure 0.3 $\Omega$.  Then, connecting those same leads to the RTD's wires, you measure 184.6 $\Omega$.  You do not happen to have an RTD table with you, but you do carry a calculator.

Calculate the approximate temperature of the fluid in this pipe, assuming the most common $\alpha$ value for 100 $\Omega$ RTDs.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The $\alpha$ value is most likely 0.00385, resulting in a calculated temperature of 218.96 $^{o}$C or 426.13 $^{o}$F.
