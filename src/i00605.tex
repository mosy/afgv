In this biogas generation system, cow manure is used as a feedstock to produce methane gas (CH$_{4}$), which is then used to fuel an engine to turn a generator and make electricity.  The waste heat from the engine is used to maintain the cascaded digesters (``reactors'' R-101 and R-102) at optimal temperatures for anaerobic bacteria to digest the manure and produce biogas (approximately 105 $^{o}$F):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00605x01.eps}$$

Determine whether the manure liquid level process of reactor R-102 will naturally be {\it self-regulating}, {\it integrating}, or {\it runaway}.

\vskip 10pt

Assuming {\it reverse} control action for TIC-48, determine the appropriate calibration for diverting valve TV-48.  TV-48 should be directing all hot engine coolant to E-46 at \underbar{\hskip 50pt} mA and should be diverting all coolant around E-46 at \underbar{\hskip 50pt} mA.

\vskip 10pt

Identify {\it two} different faults that could cause the temperature of R-101 to fall significantly below setpoint (105 $^{o}$F), assuming the system has been working just fine for years:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\bf 2 points:} The liquid level process of reactor R-102 will naturally be {\bf integrating}.  Give full credit if the student answers ``self-regulating,'' because some level control processes are that.

\vskip 10pt

{\bf 2 point for each answer:} TV-48 fully open to exchanger at \underbar{\bf 20} mA and fully diverting past exchanger at \underbar{\bf 4} mA.

\vskip 10pt

{\bf 2 points for each of the two faults:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Engine stopped
\item{} R-101 outlet pump stopped
\item{} LV-55b valve failed closed
\item{} Exchanger E-45 severely fouled
\item{} Fin-fan exchanger E-49 fan failed ``high'' (running at full speed)
\item{} {\it Others . . . ?}
\end{itemize}

If a student writes more than two faults, grant points based on the {\it weakest} answer(s).  The idea here is to not grant credit for simply ``shotgunning'' with more than two answers, hoping at least two of them will be right.
