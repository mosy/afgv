Write an equation solving for the temperature ($T$) of an RTD given its resistance at that temperature ($R_T$), its reference resistance ($R_{ref}$), its coefficient of resistance ($\alpha$), and the reference temperature ($T_{ref}$).  Assume both temperatures and the coefficient are in units of degrees Celsius:

\vskip 10pt

$T =$ 

\vskip 20pt

Next, write a similar equation solving for temperature of an RTD in degrees Fahrenheit (with $T_{ref}$ also in degrees Fahrenheit), still assuming a coefficient ($\alpha$) cast in units of degrees Celsius:

\vskip 10pt

$T =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

5 points for each correct formula:

$$T = {{R_T \over R_{ref}} - 1 \over \alpha} + T_{ref}$$

$$T = { 9 \left( {R_T \over R_{ref}} - 1 \right) \over 5 \alpha} + T_{ref}$$
