Determine the number of moles of oxygen (O$_{2}$) required to completely burn 1 mole of propane (C$_{3}$H$_{8}$) under ideal conditions, with the only combustion products being water vapor (H$_{2}$O) and carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$).  Write a balanced chemical equation for complete combustion of propane with oxygen to support your calculations.

\vskip 100pt

Then, determine the number of {\it pounds} of oxygen required to completely burn 1 {\it pound} of propane, showing in your work how to calculate the required oxygen mass.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$$\hbox{C}_3\hbox{H}_8 + 5\hbox{O}_2 \to 3\hbox{CO}_2 + 4\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$

5 moles of oxygen for every mole of propane.  3.628 pounds of oxygen for every pound of propane.

\vskip 10pt

O$_{2}$ = 32 amu.  5O$_{2}$ = 159.994 amu

\vskip 10pt

C$_{3}$H$_{8}$ = 44.0965 amu

$${159.994 \hbox{ amu} \over 44.0965 \hbox{ amu}} = 3.628$$

Therefore, there is a 3.628:1 ratio between oxygen mass and propane mass.
