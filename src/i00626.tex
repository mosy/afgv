{\bf Lab Exercise -- introduction}

\vskip 5pt

Your task is to build, document, and troubleshoot an analytical measurement system consisting of a digital electronic analytical transmitter connected to an electronic indicator or recorder (I recommend something other than an indicating controller, just to make this system different).  Process variable options include pH measurement, conductivity measurement, or any other analyzer available in the lab's collection.  

The following table of objectives show what you and your team must complete within the scheduled time for this lab exercise.  Note how some of these objectives are individual, while others are for the team as a whole:

The only ``proportional'' scoring in this activity are the lab questions, which are answered by each student individually.  A listing of potential lab questions are shown at the end of this worksheet question.  The lab questions are intended to guide your labwork as much as they are intended to measure your comprehension, and as such the instructor may ask these questions of your team day by day, rather than all at once (on a single day).

\vskip 10pt

{\bf It is essential that your team plans ahead what to accomplish each day.  A short (10 minute) team meeting at the beginning of each lab session is a good way to do this, reviewing what's already been done, what's left to do, and what assessments you should be ready for.  There is a lot of work involved with building, documenting, and troubleshooting these working instrument systems!}

As you and your team work on this system, you will invariably encounter problems.  You should always attempt to solve these problems as a team before requesting instructor assistance.  If you still require instructor assistance, write your team's color on the lab whiteboard with a brief description of what you need help on.  The instructor will meet with each team in order they appear on the whiteboard to address these problems.

\noindent
{\bf Lab Exercise -- team meeting, prototype sketch, and instrument selection}

\vskip 5pt

An important first step in completing this lab exercise is to {\bf meet with your instructor} as a team to discuss safety concerns, team performance, and specific roles for team members.  If you would like to emphasize exposure to certain equipment (e.g. use a particular type of control system, certain power tools), techniques (e.g. fabrication), or tasks to improve your skill set, this is the time to make requests of your team so that your learning during this project will be maximized.

\vskip 10pt

An absolutely essential step in completing this lab exercise is to work together as a team to {\bf sketch a prototype diagram} showing what you intend to build.  This usually takes the form of a simple electrical schematic and/or loop diagram showing all electrical connections between components, as well as any tubing or piping for fluids.  This prototype sketch need not be exhaustive in detail, but it does need to show enough detail for the instructor to determine if all components will be correctly connected for their safe function.

For example, if you intend to connect field devices to a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), your prototype sketch must show how those devices will connect to typical input/output terminals on the PLC, where electrical power will be supplied, etc.  Prototype sketches need not show all intermediary connections between components, such as terminal blocks in junction boxes between the field device and the controller.

You should practice good problem-solving techniques when creating your prototype sketch, such as consulting equipment manuals for information on component functions and marking directions of electric current, voltage polarities, and identifying electrical sources/loads.  Use this task as an opportunity to strengthen your analytical skills!  Remember that you will be challenged in this program to do all of this on your own (during ``capstone'' assessments), so do not make the mistake of relying on your teammates to figure this out for you -- instead, treat this as a problem {\it you} must solve and compare your results with those of your teammates.

Your team's prototype sketch is so important that the instructor will demand you provide this plan before any construction on your team's working system begins.  {\it Any team found constructing their system without a verified plan will be ordered to cease construction and not resume until a prototype plan has been drafted and approved!}  Similarly, you should not deviate from the prototype design without instructor approval, to ensure nothing will be done to harm equipment by way of incorrect connections.  Each member on the team should have ready access to this plan (ideally possessing their own copy of the plan) throughout the construction process.  Prototype design sketching is a skill and a habit you should cultivate in school and take with you in your new career.

\vskip 10pt

When selecting field instruments for this lab exercise, choose a {\it process analyzer} (a pH analyzer is recommended) with electronic (4-20 mA) signal output.  Many analyzer types, pH included, use remotely-mounted sensing elements along with the transmitter unit.  Be sure to locate the appropriate sensing elements for your analyzer.  For a pH analyzer, this takes the form of a {\it combination electrode} stored with its glass sensing bulb immersed in a liquid to prevent dehydration.

Consult documentation from the manufacturer's website to identify how to properly wire, power, and calibrate the transmitter.  Your instructor will check to see you have located and are familiar with the equipment manual(s).

After locating a suitable instrument and its associated documentation, you should qualitatively test it prior to installing it in your system.  For a pH transmitter, this entails inserting the sensing electrode in a cup of tap water to see that it registers a pH value somewhere near 7.0 (it may be as low as 5.0 or as high as 8.0, depending on the water quality and the condition of the sensing electrode).  If the transmitter fails to respond properly, consult the instructor for assistance before tagging it with a label explaining what it does (or what it fails to do).  Be sure not to let the pH electrode become dry, as dehydration will very quickly ruin it!

Bear in mind that analyzers powered by their own (non-loop) power source typically behave as current {\it sources}, and must be connected to the indicating instrument differently than a loop-powered device!  Consult the manufacturer's documentation for wiring details.

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Planning a functioning system should take no more than an hour if the team is working efficiently, and will save you hours of frustration (and possible component destruction!).}

{\bf Lab Exercise -- building the system}

\vskip 5pt

The Instrumentation lab is set up to facilitate the construction of working instrument ``loops,'' with over a dozen junction boxes, pre-pulled signal cables, and ``racks'' set up with 2-inch vertical pipes for mounting instruments.  The only wires you should need to install to build a working system are those connecting the field instrument to the nearest junction box, and then small ``jumper'' cables connecting different pre-installed cables together within intermediate junction boxes.

After getting your prototype sketch approved by the instructor, you are cleared to begin building your system.  Many analyzers are designed to be panel-mounted rather than field-mounted (attached to 2-inch pipes using special brackets and U-bolts).  Feel free to set your panel-mount analyzer on a table or shelf in lieu of mounting it in an actual panel.  

Select a specific loop controller or indicator to act as a display for the measured chemical concentration.  Your instructor may choose the indicator for your team.  

Finally, your analyzer system needs to have a loop number, so all instruments may be properly labeled.  This loop number needs to be unique, so that another team does not label their instruments and cables the same as yours.  One way to make your loop number unique is to use the equivalent resistor color-code value for your team's color in the loop number.  For example, if you are the ``Red'' team, your loop number could be ``2''. 

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Common mistakes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Neglecting to consult the manufacturer's documentation for field instruments (e.g. how to wire them, how to calibrate them).
\item{} Mounting the field instrument(s) in awkward positions, making it difficult to reach connection terminals or to remove covers when installed.
\item{} Failing to tug on each and every wire where it terminates to ensure a mechanically sound connection.
\item{} Students working on portions of the system in isolation, not sharing with their teammates what they did and how.  It is important that the whole team learns all aspects of their system!
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Building a functioning system should take no more than one full lab session (3 hours) if all components are readily available and the team is working efficiently!}





\vfil \eject

\noindent
{\bf Lab Exercise -- documenting the system}

\vskip 5pt

Each student must sketch their own {\it loop diagram} for their team's system, following proper ISA conventions.  Sample loop diagrams are shown in the next question in this worksheet.  These loop diagrams must be {\it comprehensive} and {\it detailed}, showing every wire connection, every cable, every terminal block, range points, etc.  The principle to keep in mind here is to make the loop diagram so complete and unambiguous that anyone can follow it to see what connects to what, even someone unfamiliar with industrial instrumentation.  In industry, loops are often constructed by contract personnel with limited understanding of how the system is supposed to function.  The loop diagrams they follow must be so complete that they will be able to connect everything properly without necessarily understanding how it is supposed to work.

Every instrument and every signal cable in your loop needs to be properly labeled with an ISA-standard tag number.  An easy way to do this is to wrap a short piece of masking tape around each cable (and placed on each instrument) then writing on that masking tape with a permanent marker.  Although no industry standard exists for labeling signal cables, a good recommendation is to label each two-wire cable with the tag number of the field instrument it goes to.  Thus, every length of two-wire cable in an analytical transmitter circuit should be labeled ``AT-$x$'' (where ``$x$'' is the loop number), every flow control valve should be labeled ``FV-$x$'', etc.  Remember that the entire loop is defined by the process variable it measures: if the PV is {\it temperature} then the transmitter with be a {\it T}T, the control valve will be a {\it T}V, the indicator with be a {\it T}I, etc.

When your entire team is finished drafting your individual loop diagrams, call the instructor to do an inspection of the loop.  Here, the instructor will have students take turns going through the entire loop, with the other students checking their diagrams for errors and omissions along the way.  During this time the instructor will also inspect the quality of the installation, identifying problems such as frayed wires, improperly crimped terminals, poor cable routing, missing labels, lack of wire duct covers, etc.  The team must correct all identified errors in order to receive credit for their system.  

After successfully passing the inspection, each team member needs to place their loop diagram in the diagram holder located in the middle of the lab behind the main control panel.  When it comes time to troubleshoot another team's system, this is where you will go to find a loop diagram for that system!

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Common mistakes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Forgetting to label all signal wires (see example loop diagrams).
\item{} Forgetting to label all field instruments with their own tag names (e.g. AT-83).
\item{} Forgetting to note all wire colors.
\item{} Forgetting to put your name on the loop diagram!
\item{} Basing your diagram off of a team-mate's diagram, rather than closely inspecting the system for yourself.
\item{} Not placing loop sheet instruments in the correct orientation (field instruments on the left, control room instruments on the right).
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Creating and inspecting accurate loop diagrams should take no more than one full lab session (3 hours) if the team is working efficiently!}





\vfil \eject

\noindent
{\bf Lab Exercise -- instrument calibration}

\vskip 5pt

Each team must calibrate the transmitter to ensure it interprets chemical composition accurately and outputs an accurate current.  Then, each team member must configure the transmitter for a unique range (set the LRV and URV parameters) and scale the indicator to register in the proper engineering units (e.g. a pH analyzer ranged for 4 to 12 pH should actually register 4 to 12 pH back at the control room display).  The accuracy of this ranging will be checked by the instructor stimulating the analyzer with a random sample while each student verifies the indicator display.

As in all cases where an instrument must be calibrated, you will need to check the instrument's response against one or more {\it standards}.  In this case, the ideal standard to use for an analyzer is a chemical solution of precisely known composition.  For pH instruments, this takes the form of {\it pH buffer solutions}, easily mixed from distilled water and pH buffer powder.  For gas analyzers, this takes the form of either ambient air (21\% oxygen content) or more likely bottled {\it calibration gases}.  Chemical calibration standards will be made available by the instructor, and should be used sparingly as they tend to be expensive.

Document the accuracy of your transmitter's measurement at two (minimum) different points throughout its sensing range using these two tables:

When finished calibrating your team's transmitter, be sure to place a calibration tag on it showing the range and the date it was calibrated.  A set of calibration tags are shown here which you may cut out and tape to the transmitter after completing your calibration:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00626x01.eps}$$

Each student, however, must individually re-range the transmitter and the receiving instrument (indicator, controller, and/or recorder).  Re-ranging an analyzer is usually done using a keypad and display on the transmitter unit, following the manufacturer's instructions.  Each student's ranging is confirmed by the instructor by applying a random chemical concentration to the sensing element and verifying that the indicating controller reads the same (to within $\pm$ 1\% of span).

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Common mistakes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Choosing a calibration (``trim'') range that is substantially less than the final range of measurement when installed.  As a general rule, you should trim the sensor of the transmitter to cover the broadest range of measurement possible with your calibration equipment.
\item{} Neglecting to place a calibration tag on the transmitter after ``trimming'' it.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\bf Lab Exercise -- troubleshooting}

\vskip 5pt

The most challenging aspect of this lab exercise is {\it troubleshooting}, where you demonstrate your ability to logically isolate a problem in the system.  All troubleshooting is done on an individual basis (no team credit!), and must be done {\it on a system you did not help build}, so that you must rely on loop diagrams to find your way around the system instead of from your own memory of building it.

Each student is given 5 minutes to identify both the general location and nature of the fault, logically justifying all diagnostic steps taken.  All troubleshooting activities will take place under direct instructor supervision to ensure students are working independently and efficiently. 

Failure to correctly identify both the general location and nature of the fault within the allotted time, and/or failing to demonstrate rational diagnostic procedure to the supervising instructor will disqualify the effort, in which case the student must re-try with a different fault.  Multiple re-tries are permitted with no reduction in grade.

A standard multimeter is the only test equipment allowed during the time limit.  No diagnostic circuit breaks are allowed except by instructor permission, and then only after correctly explaining what trouble this could cause in a real system.  

The instructor will review each troubleshooting effort after completion, highlighting good and bad points for the purpose of learning.  Troubleshooting is a skill born of practice and failure, so do not be disappointed in yourself if you must make multiple attempts to pass!  One of the important life-lessons embedded in this activity is how to deal with failure, because it {\it will} eventually happen to you on the job!  There is no dishonor in failing to properly diagnose a fault after doing your level best.  The only dishonor is in taking shortcuts or in giving up.

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Common mistakes:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Neglecting to take measurements with your multimeter.
\item{} Incorrectly interpreting the loop diagram (e.g. thinking you're at the wrong place in the system when taking measurements).
\item{} Confusion measuring current and voltage values in self-powered (rather than loop-powered) 4-20 mA signal circuits.
\item{} Incorrect multimeter usage (e.g. AC rather than DC, wrong range, wrong test lead placement).  This is especially true when a student comes to lab unprepared and must borrow someone else's meter that is different from theirs!
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Remember that the purpose of the troubleshooting exercise is to foster and assess your ability to intelligently diagnose a complex system.  Finding the fault by luck, or by trial-and-error inspection, is not a successful demonstration of skill.  The only thing that counts as competence is your demonstrated ability to logically analyze and isolate the problem, correctly explaining all your steps!}

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Troubleshooting takes a lot of lab time, usually at least two 3-hour lab sessions for everyone in a full class to successfully pass.  Be sure your team budgets for this amount of time as you plan your work, and also be sure to take advantage of your freedom to observe others as they troubleshoot, to better learn this art.}

The final step of this lab exercise is to decommission your team's entire system and re-stock certain components back to their proper storage locations, the purpose of which being to prepare the lab for the next lab exercise.  Remove your system documentation (e.g. loop diagram) from the common holding area, either discarding it or keeping it for your own records.  Also, remove instrument tag labels (e.g. FT-101) from instruments and from cables.  Perform general clean-up of your lab space, disposing of all trash, placing all tools back in their proper storage locations, sweeping up bits of wire off the floor and out of junction boxes, etc.

{\bf Loop diagrams / inspections:}

I strongly recommend checking off students' loop diagrams while you inspect their loop (checking for secure wiring, proper tubing, good conduit installation, etc.) with them.  Have all team members take you on a ``tour'' of their completed loop, with each team member explaining a different portion of the loop you select while using their own loop diagram as a guide.  While a student is explaining their section of the loop, you can check the other students' loop diagrams for accuracy.  This not only saves time by consolidating the tasks of loop inspection and loop diagram verification, but it also ensures students can actually relate their loop diagrams to the loop they have built and articulate that understanding to you.

\item{$(4)$} Suppose AIR-310 registers 2.5 pH at all times, regardless of changes in the actual pH of the water in the Bank C trough.  A technician measures 0 VDC between terminals 21 and IN0$-$.  Identify one specific fault which could account for all the symptoms, as well as one specific component in this system which is definitely not to blame.  Be sure to specify ``open'' or ``shorted'' if your specified fault is electrical in nature:
