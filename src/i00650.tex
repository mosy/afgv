Suppose we needed to measure the temperature of a batch ``reactor'' vessel at a biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility.  We know the temperature of this particular vessel may range between 20$^{o}$ F and 300$^{o}$ F, and we also know we need the temperature measurement to be as precise and accurate as possible at all points within this range.

Choose the best temperature sensing element for this application from the list below, and then explain {\it why} it will provide the best accuracy for this application:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} 100 ohm platinum RTD
\item{} Type S thermocouple
\item{} Type J thermocouple
\item{} Class III filled-bulb (with pneumatic transmitter)
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The {\bf RTD} would be the best choice, due to the superior linearity of this sensing element compared to the others.  Also, RTDs do not suffer the problem of reference junction compensation like thermocouples do, or the various mechanical sources of error like filled bulbs do.
