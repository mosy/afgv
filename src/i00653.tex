An RTD measures the temperature of saturated steam at the steam drum of a boiler:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00653x01.eps}$$

The RTD connects to a bridge circuit via three wires, to register temperature at a sensitive voltmeter mechanism in the control room:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00653x02.eps}$$

Suppose the boiler operator decides to decrease the pressure of the boiler over a period of time.  Identify the effects this pressure change will have on these voltage drops in the RTD circuit:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $V_{R1}$ will {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}?
\item{} $V_{R2}$ will {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}?
\item{} $V_{R3}$ will {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}?
\item{} $V_{RTD}$ will {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}?
\item{} Explain the relationship between boiler pressure and boiler temperature:
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $V_{R1}$ will {\bf stay the same}
\item{} $V_{R2}$ will {\bf stay the same}
\item{} $V_{R3}$ will {\bf increase}
\item{} $V_{RTD}$ will {\bf decrease}
\item{} Explain the relationship between boiler pressure and boiler temperature:
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

{\it Boiler pressure and boiler temperature are directly related: as pressure decreases, temperature also decreases.}
