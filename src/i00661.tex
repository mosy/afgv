Convert between the following controller {\it gain} and {\it proportional band} values:

\vskip 10pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Gain = 1.78 ; Proportional band = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Gain = 0.84 ; Proportional band = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Gain = 1.21 ; Proportional band = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Proportional band = 45\% ; Gain = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Proportional band = 270\% ; Gain = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\end{itemize}

\underbar{file i00661}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Award only half-credit for answers expressed inappropriately (e.g. PB values not in percent, gain values in percent)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Gain = 1.78 ; Proportional band = \underbar{\bf 56.18\%}
\item{} Gain = 0.84 ; Proportional band = \underbar{\bf 119.05\%}
\item{} Gain = 1.21 ; Proportional band = \underbar{\bf 82.64\%}
\item{} Proportional band = 45\% ; Gain = \underbar{\bf 2.22}
\item{} Proportional band = 270\% ; Gain = \underbar{\bf 0.370}
\end{itemize}
