The following pneumatic transducer converts between a 3-15 PSI signal range and a 6-30 PSI signal range.  Based on the illustration shown here, which pressure range corresponds to the input and which pressure range corresponds to the output?  Does it input 3-15 PSI and output 6-30 PSI, or vice-versa?  How can you tell??

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The input pressure range is the greater of the two (6-30 PSI), and the output is the lesser of the two (3-15 PSI).
