A differential pressure flowmeter (e.g. orifice plate, venturi, etc.) has a calibrated flow range of 0 to 1000 GPM and a differential pressure range of 0 to 200 inches of water.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate a new differential pressure range for the transmitter to give this flowmeter a new flow range of 0 to 750 GPM.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate a new differential pressure range for the transmitter to give this flowmeter a new flow range of 0 to 1200 GPM.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate a new differential pressure range for the transmitter to give this flowmeter a new flow range of 0 to 510 GPM, and express this new pressure range in units of PSI rather than inches of water.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

New $\Delta$P range = 0 to 112.5 inches of water for $Q$ = 0 to 750 GPM

\vskip 10pt

New $\Delta$P range = 0 to 288 inches of water for $Q$ = 0 to 1200 GPM

\vskip 10pt

New $\Delta$P range = 0 to 1.879 PSI for $Q$ = 0 to 510 GPM

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$$Q = 70.71 \sqrt{\Delta P}$$
