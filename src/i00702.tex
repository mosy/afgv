Suppose an orifice plate is rated as follows:

\vskip 10pt

\hskip 40pt 0 to 1500 GPM ; 0 to 100 "WC

\vskip 10pt

Calculate a new differential pressure range to give this same orifice plate a new flow-measurement range of 0 to 1200 GPM.

\vskip 10pt

New $\Delta$P range = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}

\underbar{file i00702}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

New $\Delta$P range = \underbar{\bf 0 to 64 "WC}

%(END_ANSWER)
