Two flowmeters are used to simultaneously measure the flow rate of a liquid through a pipe:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00710x01.eps}$$

Suppose the Coriolis flowmeter's measurement decreases while the magnetic flowmeter's measurement increases at the same time.  Would this indicate a {\it increase} or a {\it decrease} in liquid density?  Explain your answer in detail.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The liquid density has {\bf decreased}, because the Coriolis flowmeter shows less mass flow while the magnetic flowmeter shows greater fluid velocity (more volumetric flow).

I recommend awarding half-credit for the increase/decrease answer, and half-credit for a correct written explanation.
