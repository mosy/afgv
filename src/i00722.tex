A great tool for streamlining your electronic job-search efforts is to use a web technology called {\it RSS} (Really Simple Syndication) to ``subscribe'' to job postings from some of the major job-search engines such as {\tt Indeed.com} and {\tt Monster.com}.  With RSS, the job postings appear on your reader screen kind of like incoming messages in an email program.

Your assignment here is to set up an RSS reader for yourself, subscribe to at least one search engine ``RSS feed'' for instrument technician jobs, then print a screenshot of your RSS reader showing at least three instrument technician job postings.  The screenshot should show that this is {\it your} RSS reader page (e.g. your login ID appearing on the page) and not someone else's.
