A common yet unfortunate trend seen in many r\'esum\'es are lists of self-described attributes.  Examples of such include:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} ``Hard-working and motivated''
\item{} ``Easy to get along with''
\item{} ``Creative problem-solver''
\item{} ``Dedicated''
\item{} ``Clean-cut and professional''
\item{} ``Critical thinker''
\item{} ``Conscientious''
\item{} ``Always punctual''
\end{itemize}

Explain why self-endorsements such as these have little or no value in a r\'esum\'e, from the perspective of the employer reading them.

\vskip 50pt

Next, give a specific example of how one could present any of the listed positive attributes in a r\'esum\'e, but in such a way that is factual (not subjective) and does a better job capturing the employer's attention.

A general answer to the second part of this question is to cite specific accomplishments at work or in school where the positive attribute was integral to the success.

{\it Please note that the above sentence does not constitute an answer.  You still need to show a specific example of how this could be done in a r\'esum\'e.}
