Suppose an old orifice plate is replaced by a new orifice plate with a larger hole.  What effect will this change have on the differential pressure generated by the plate at any given flow rate?  What effect will this change have on the amount of flow it can measure with the same $\Delta$P range?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A larger-hole orifice plate will generate {\it less} $\Delta$P for any given flow rate, and can measure {\it greater} flow rates with the same $\Delta$P range.
