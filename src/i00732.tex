Calculate the volumetric flow rate (in units of cubic meters per minute) for water flowing out of the 25.4 cm diameter (ID) discharge pipe of a centrifugal pump at a velocity of 7.62 meter per second.  Then, convert that flow rate into units of gallons per minute.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Q=Av=\pi(\frac{0.254m}{2})^2\cdot 7.62$ = 0.386 mÂ³/s = 6120 GPM

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, I am assuming an inside pipe diameter of exactly 10.00 inches.
