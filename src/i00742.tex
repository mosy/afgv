%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

As always, tell the truth!  You certainly do not want to fabricate an answer, nor do you necessarily want to present yourself as a liability.  A good, general strategy for answering a question like this is to state a weakness, then follow up with a description of how you have overcome (or are overcoming) this weakness.  No one is perfect, and your interviewers know this.  What they want is an employee who is willing and able to improve, which is the real point of asking a question like this.

It might be a good idea to ask your students how they (personally) would answer a question like this.
