Suppose a particular hydraulic pump outputs a flow rate of 8 gallons per minute (GPM) when turned by an electric induction motor at 1720 RPM.  How fast would this pump be able to move the piston in an hydraulic cylinder with a diameter of 3.35 inches?

Also, calculate the hydraulic system pressure if the cylinder has to exert 1900 pounds of force as it moves.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Far more important than arriving at the correct answer(s) is to develop a sound problem-solving {\it strategy}.  Explain in your own words {\it how} you were able to arrive at the correct answers in this problem.
\item{} A useful strategy for problem-solving is to modify the problem in order to {\it simplify} it into a form that is easier to solve.  In this case, we might try simplifying the problem by adding a time duration to this scenario: imagine the pump running for exactly {\it one minute} and seeing how far the piston would theoretically move over that span of time.  This converts the problem from one of {\it liquid flow rate} and {\it speed} into the simpler terms of {\it liquid volume} and {\it distance}.
\item{} A useful strategy for problem-solving is to {\it sketch a picture} of the problem in order to better visualize the given conditions and any unknown variables.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Converting 8 GPM into a cubic volume flow rate:

$$\left(8 \hbox{ gal} \over 1 \hbox{ min} \right) \left(231 \hbox{ in}^3 \over 1 \hbox{ gal}\right) = 1848 \hbox{ in}^3 \hbox{ per minute}$$

\vskip 10pt

Calculating the area of the piston's cylinder:

$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \left(3.35 \hbox{ in} \over 2 \right)^2 = 8.814 \hbox{ in}^2$$

\vskip 10pt

Finally, calculating the piston's travel speed:

$$\left(1848 \hbox{ in}^3 \over \hbox{ min} \right) \left(1 \over 8.814 \hbox{ in}^2 \right) = 209.66 \hbox{ in/min} = 3.494 \hbox{ in/sec}$$

\vskip 10pt

Calculating necessary hydraulic pressure to generate 1900 lbs of force:

$$P = {F \over A} = {1900 \hbox{ lb} \over 8.814 \hbox{ in}^2} = 215.56 \hbox{ PSI}$$
