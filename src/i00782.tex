From an actuator's perspective, which is an easier kind of valve to position: a single-ported globe valve, or a double-ported globe valve (all other factors being equal)?  Why is this?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Double-ported globe valves are easier to position than single-ported globe valves, because double-ported valve trim minimizes the force produced by fluid pressure on the plug(s).  With less process-induced force on the valve stem, the actuator has an easier job of moving the valve to any given position.
