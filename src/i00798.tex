The following force-balance mechanism responds to an applied force by increasing its output pressure:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00798x01.eps}$$

How will this mechanism respond to the exact same amount of manual force applied at a {\it lower} level, closer to the pivot point?

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00798x02.eps}$$

Be sure to explain {\it why} this is!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The output pressure will not rise as much, with the same force applied to a point closer to the pivot.
