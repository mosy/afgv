A person is floating in a swimming pool on an inflatable plastic cushion, holding a cup of drinking water.  If this person accidently dumps their drinking water into the pool, does the water level in the pool increase, decrease, or stay the same?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The level in the pool remains the same, because the water displaced by the inflatable cushion is the amount of water equal in weight to the cushion plus the person plus the cup plus the water in the cup.  Spilling that cup-worth of water in the pool lightens the weight on the cushion which makes it displace less water, but this reduced displacement is {\it precisely equal} to the amount of water spilled into the pool.  Therefore, there will be no change whatsoever in the pool's level.
