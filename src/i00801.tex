A person is floating in a swimming pool on an inflatable plastic cushion, holding a bowling ball.  If this person accidently dumps the bowling ball into the pool, does the water level in the pool increase, decrease, or stay the same?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The level in the pool will decrease, because the water displaced by the inflatable cushion is the amount of water equal in weight to the cushion plus the person plus the bowling ball.  Dropping the bowling ball into the pool lightens the weight on the cushion which makes it displace less water.  The bowling ball will only displace as much water as its volume, which is less water than what it weighs.  Therefore, the total amount of displaced water will decrease and the pool's level will correspondingly decrease.
