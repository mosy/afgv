If an ultrasonic level instrument is used to measure the level of nitric acid in a vessel, and the density of that acid increases over time due to increased concentration, how will the instrument respond?  Will it register an increased acid level, a decreased acid level, or will its indication remain the same as before?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There will be no change in instrument indication resulting from a density change of the acid.  Only the {\it vapor} density above the liquid affects the speed of sound, which is the primary non-level variable affecting level measurement.
