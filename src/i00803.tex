If a tape-and-float level instrument is used to measure the level of alcohol in a vessel, and the density of that alcohol suddenly decreases, how will the instrument respond?  Will it register an increased alcohol level, a decreased alcohol level, or will its indication remain the same as before?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There will be no change in instrument indication resulting from a density change of the alcohol, so long as the liquid remains denser than the float.  The buoyancy of the float will be {\it slightly} affected by the liquid's density, but not much.
