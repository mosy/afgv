Suppose this temperature-sensing circuit falsely registers a very low temperature (full downscale) when the RTD sensor is sensing room temperature (20 $^{o}$C).  A digital multimeter (DMM) connected between test points {\bf A} and {\bf C} registers 1 volt:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00804x01.eps}$$

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

Finally, identify the {\it next} diagnostic test or measurement you would make on this system.  Explain how the result(s) of this next test or measurement help further identify the location and/or nature of the fault.

A good ``next test'' would be to use your multimeter to measure voltage across the voltmeter or across the RTD terminals.

This question is a good candidate for a ``Virtual Troubleshooting'' exercise.  Presenting the diagram to students, you first imagine in your own mind a particular fault in the system.  Then, you present one or more symptoms of that fault (something noticeable by an operator or other user of the system).  Students then propose various diagnostic tests to perform on this system to identify the nature and location of the fault, as though they were technicians trying to troubleshoot the problem.  Your job is to tell them what the result(s) would be for each of the proposed diagnostic tests, documenting those results where all the students can see.

During and after the exercise, it is good to ask students follow-up questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What does the result of the last diagnostic test tell you about the fault?
\item{} Suppose the results of the last diagnostic test were different.  What then would that result tell you about the fault?
\item{} Is the last diagnostic test the best one we could do?
\item{} What would be the ideal order of tests, to diagnose the problem in as few steps as possible?
\end{itemize}
