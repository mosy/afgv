Suppose an old orifice plate is replaced by a new orifice plate with a lesser {\it Beta ratio}.  What effect will this change have on the differential pressure generated by the plate at any given flow rate?  What effect will this change have on the amount of flow it can measure with the same $\Delta$P range?  What effect will this change have on permanent pressure loss and energy dissipation resulting from the orifice plate?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A smaller-Beta orifice plate will generate {\it more} $\Delta$P for any given flow rate, and will measure {\it lesser} flow rates with the same $\Delta$P range.  A smaller-Beta orifice plate will also induce greater permanent pressure loss and energy dissipation.
