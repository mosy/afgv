``Downloading'' means all the configuration data we input gets sent over the Ethernet network to the assigned control hardware where it will be executed (page 4-53).

\vskip 10pt

Downloading a control module to a working controller has the potential to interfere with the existing control strategies, and therefore might mess up the process being controlled!
