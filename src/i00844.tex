Test leads for DC voltmeters are usually just two individual lengths of wire connecting the meter to a pair of probes.  For highly sensitive instruments, a special type of two-conductor cable called {\it coaxial cable} is generally used instead of two individual wires.  Coaxial cable -- where a center conductor is ``shielded'' by an outer braid or foil that serves as the other conductor -- has excellent immunity to induced ``noise'' from electric and magnetic fields:

When measuring high-frequency AC voltages, however, the parasitic capacitance and inductance of the coaxial cable may present problems.  We may represent these distributed characteristics of the cable as ``lumped'' parameters: a single capacitor and a single inductor modeling the cable's behavior:

$$\includegraphics[width=5.5cm]{i00844x02.eps}$$

Typical parasitic values for a 10-foot cable would be 260 pF of capacitance and 650 $\mu$H of inductance.  The voltmeter itself, of course, is not without its own inherent impedances, either.  For the sake of this example, let's consider the meter's ``input impedance'' to be a simple resistance of 1 M$\Omega$.

Calculate what voltage the meter would register when measuring the output of a 20 volt AC source, at these frequencies:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $f =$ 1 Hz ; $V_{meter} =$
\item{} $f =$ 1 kHz ; $V_{meter} =$
\item{} $f =$ 10 kHz ; $V_{meter} =$
\item{} $f =$ 100 kHz ; $V_{meter} =$
\item{} $f =$ 1 MHz ; $V_{meter} =$
\end{itemize}

There is no need to express your answers in complex-number form, since an analog voltmeter does not register the phase angle of the measured voltage:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $f =$ 1 Hz ; $V_{meter} =$ 20 V
\item{} $f =$ 1 kHz ; $V_{meter} =$ 20 V
\item{} $f =$ 10 kHz ; $V_{meter} =$ 20.01 V
\item{} $f =$ 100 kHz ; $V_{meter} =$ 21.43 V
\item{} $f =$ 1 MHz ; $V_{meter} =$ 3.526 V
\end{itemize}
