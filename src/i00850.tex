Calculate the necessary time-dial setting for a 51 protective relay with an ``extremely inverse'' characteristic assuming a pick-up (tap setting) of 5 amps, a CT ratio of 1200:5, and a desired trip time of 10 seconds for a fault current value of 3.6 kA.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$t = T \left(0.0352 + {5.67 \over {M^2 - 1}} \right) \hskip 30pt \hbox{Extremely inverse curve}$$

Solving for the time-dial setting ($T$):

$$T = {t \over \left(0.0352 + {5.67 \over {M^2 - 1}} \right)}$$

A fault current of 3.6 kA through a 1200:5 ratio CT gives a CT secondary current of 15 amps.  Given the relay's pick-up value of 5 amps, this will be 3$\times$ the pick-up current ($M = 3$).  Solving for a desired tripping time of 10 seconds ($t$):

$$T = {10 \over \left(0.0352 + {5.67 \over {3^2 - 1}} \right)}$$

$$T = 13.44$$

Therefore we must set the time dial of this relay at 13.44.
