%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A ``fugitive emission'' is a leak of volatile organic substance from any non-point source (any source other than smokestack or other controlled vents, which are ``point'' sources).

According to Emerson's {\it Control Valve Handbook} (4th edition), fugitive emissions may account for over 400 million pounds of material lost in American industry per year!
