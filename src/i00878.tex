Two very popular valve packing materials are {\it graphite} and {\it Teflon}.  Both materials possess inherent lubricating properties, which is a very good trait for a packing material in a control valve.  However, there exist substantial differences in performance and application of these two packing materials.  Elaborate on these differences, and identify processes where each would be applicable.

\vskip 10pt

Also, explain what a {\it bellows seal} is, and how it is a completely different way to seal the stems of valves compared to either Teflon or graphite packing.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Bellows seals exhibit some wonderful advantages over friction-type packings, but they suffer some major disadvantages as well.  Identify some of the major limitations of bellows seals when used to seal control valve stems.

\noindent
{\bf Teflon:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Relatively narrow temperature range (-40$^{o}$ F to 450$^{o}$ F)
\item{} Does not contribute to galvanic corrosion of valve stem
\item{} Not suitable for nuclear service (radiation destroys PTFE)
\item{} Minimal valve stem friction
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf Graphite:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Wide temperature range (cryogenic to 1200$^{o}$ F)
\item{} Permits galvanic corrosion of valve stem
\item{} Suitable for nuclear service
\item{} More stem friction than Teflon
\end{itemize}

A {\it bellows seal} looks like a skinny accordion which fastens to the valve stem and to the bonnet, forming a leak-proof seal with very little friction.
