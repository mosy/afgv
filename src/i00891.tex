Suppose a coil spring to be used in a piston actuator assembly needs to store 675 ft-lbs of potential energy when compressed.  Supposing the spring constant for this spring is 290 lbs per inch of compression, how far must the spring be compressed to store the needed amount of energy?

\vskip 10pt

Compression = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} inches

\vskip 10pt

Furthermore, write a formula solving for potential energy (units of {\it ft-lbs}) stored in this spring given the amount of compression (units of {\it inches}):

\vskip 10pt

$E_p = $

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Half-credit for numerical answer, half-credit for formula:

\vskip 10pt

Compression = \underbar{\bf 7.4741} inches

\vskip 10pt

$E_p = {kx^2 \over 24}$
