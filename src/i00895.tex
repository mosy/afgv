A differential pressure flowmeter (orifice plate and $\Delta$P transmitter) has a calibrated flow range of 0 to 1200 GPM and a differential pressure range of 0 to 150 inches of water.  Calculate a new $\Delta$P range for a new flow range of 0 to 600 GPM:

\vskip 10pt

New $\Delta$P range for 600 GPM flow: \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
