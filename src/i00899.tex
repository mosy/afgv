When benzene (C$_{6}$H$_{6}$) is burned with oxygen (O$_{2}$) under ideal conditions, the products are water vapor (H$_{2}$O) and carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$).  Write a balanced equation showing all reactants and all reaction products in the proper proportions.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Suppose benzene were burned in a ``rich'' environment (too little oxygen).  What other combustion products might form then?
\end{itemize}
