An ohmmeter registers a resistance of 8.5 k$\Omega$ when connected between two metal plates immersed in a sample of water.  The metal plates each measure 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters, and are separated by a distance of 10 centimeters:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00907x01.eps}$$

Calculate the specific conductivity of this water, expressed in units of microsiemens per centimeter ($\mu$S/cm):

\vskip 10pt

Specific conductivity = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} $\mu$S/cm
