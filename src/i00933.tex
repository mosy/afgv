This cross-limited air/fuel ratio control system is supposed to maintain the fuel-to-air ratio at 1:1 for all firing conditions.  Suppose it has been functioning properly for a long time at a 30\% firing rate (i.e. firing command signal = 30\%; air flow = 30\%; fuel flow = 30\%):

\noindent
Choose the best answer describing the immediate effect on this process if the fuel flow transmitter suddenly fails with a {\it high} signal:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} The burner's fuel/air mixture will become {\it rich} (i.e. too much fuel for the amount of air)
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The burner's fuel/air mixture will become {\it lean} (i.e. too much air for the amount of fuel)
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Both air and fuel valves will shut off causing the burner to go out
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Both air and fuel valves will open 100\% causing the burner to output maximum fire
\end{itemize}
