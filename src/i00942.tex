Sketch connecting wires to show how to simulate an {\it RTD} signal to the input of this electronic temperature transmitter using a potentiometer:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00942x01.eps}$$

Assume the transmitter is properly configured for {\bf 2-wire} RTD input, and that the potentiometer is of sufficient precision and resolution that there is no need to connect it to any other resistors to form a network.

Any correct solution will include these attributes:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Potentiometer connected as a rheostat (only wiper and one other terminal used, alternatively with third terminal common to wiper)
\item{} One wire from transmitter to wiper
\item{} One wire from transmitter to other rheostat terminal
\end{itemize}
