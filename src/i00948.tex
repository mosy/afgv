A differential pressure flowmeter (orifice plate and $\Delta$P transmitter) has a calibrated flow range of 0 to 1000 GPM and a differential pressure range of 0 to 80 inches of water.  Calculate a new $\Delta$P range for a new flow range of 0 to 900 GPM:

\vskip 10pt

New $\Delta$P range for 900 GPM flow: \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
