Calculate the mass of 74.3 moles of saturated steam at 103 PSIA and 330 $^{o}$F:

\vskip 10pt

$m$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} grams

\vskip 20pt

Calculate the amount of heat liberated by this same quantity of steam as it condenses to water at room temperature (70 $^{o}$F) and atmospheric pressure (14.7 PSIA).  Use 453.59 grams per pound for your unit conversions:

\vskip 10pt

$Q$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} BTU

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The steam's mass will be {\bf 1337.4 grams}, or 2.948 pounds.  According to the steam table given at the end of the exam, the total heat (enthalpy) of 103 PSIA saturated steam is 1186.9 BTU/lb.  The enthalpy of 70 $^{o}$F water according to the same table is 38.06 BTU/lb.  Therefore the loss in enthalpy is 1186.9 BTU/lb $-$ 38.06 BTU/lb = 1148.84 BTU/lb, and 2.948 pounds of steam losing this much heat per pound equates to {\bf 3387.33 BTU} of heat liberated.  

\vskip 10pt

If one were to use the formulae $Q = mL$ (assuming 970 BTU/lb for $L$) and $Q = mc \Delta T$ to calculate heat lost by the steam's phase change and subsequent cooling, the result would be:

$$(2.948)(970) + (2.948)(1)(330 - 70) = 3626.04 \hbox{ BTU}$$

This less-precise answer of {\bf 3626.04 BTU} is also acceptable.
