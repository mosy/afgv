%A newly-installed pH measurement system does not seem to be measuring the pH of the process liquid accurately.  The indicating controller's display does not match the display of the hand-held pH meter used by an operator:

Et Ph målesystem som nydling er installert ser ikke ut til å måle korrekt. Displayet på regulatoren stemmer ikke med det håndholdet Ph meteret.

%The calibrated range of the 4-wire pH transmitter is supposed to be 2 to 12 pH, with a 4 to 20 mA signal output range.  An instrument technician begins to diagnose the problem by taking a loop calibrator and measuring the current signal being sent to the indicating controller.  The loop calibrator registers 15.43 milliamps.
Det kalibrerte området til den 4-leder koblede pH transmitteren skal v{\ae}re 2-12 pH, med henholdsvis 4-20 mA. En automatiker bruker en loop-kalibrator for å måle signalet som blir sendt til kontrolleren, og får et resultat på 15.43 mA.

%\item{$\bullet$} A problem-solving technique useful for making proper connections in pictorial circuit diagrams is to first identify the directions of all DC currents entering and exiting component terminals, as well as the respective voltage polarity marks (+,-) for those terminals, based on your knowledge of each component acting either as an electrical {\it source} or an electrical {\it load}.  Discuss and compare how these arrows and polarity marks simplify the task of properly connecting wires between components.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

15.43 milliamps of current equates to a percentage value of 71.44\%:

$${15.43 - 4 \over 16} \times 100\% = 71.44\%$$

This, in turn, represents a pH value of:

$$0.7144 \times (12 - 2) + 2 = 9.144 \hbox{ pH}$$

\vskip 10pt

This largely agrees with the controller's display, which tells us there is a {\it slight} calibration error on either the part of the controller or the resistor.  The huge discrepancy between this calculated pH value and what the hand-held pH meter registers, however, tells us there is either a problem with the pH transmitter, the pH probe, or the hand-held meter.  We may further conclude there is no problem with the 250 $\Omega$ resistor or the indicating controller.
 
\vskip 10pt

The proper setup of the loop calibrator is to place it into the ``READ'' (measure) mode so that it functions as a simple ammeter, then connect it in series with the output of the 4-wire transmitter.  This may be done either with the indicating controller still in the circuit, or removed from the circuit.

{\bf Determining the utility of given diagnostic tests:} imagine the resistor fails open in this circuit (but don't tell this to students!).  Present the operator's observation(s) to the students, have them consider possible faults and diagnostic strategies, and then propose the following diagnostic tests one by one.  Have students rate the value of each test, determining whether or not each test would give us useful information (i.e. tell us something we don't already know).  Also have students describe what result in particular might be the most informative for any of these tests, because the same test might yield conclusive or inconclusive results depending on the fault:
