A level transmitter needs to be installed in a process where the liquid density happens to change over time (anywhere from 52 lb/ft$^{3}$ to 55 lb/ft$^{3}$, unpredictably) and the vapor density also changes over time (anywhere from 0.033 lb/ft$^{3}$ to 0.048 lb/ft$^{3}$, unpredictably).  Determine whether or not each of the following level-sensing instruments would be appropriate for this application (i.e. whether or not each technology would yield reliable and reasonably accurate measurements of process level):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Sightglass: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Ultrasonic (top-mounted): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Hydrostatic: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\end{itemize}
