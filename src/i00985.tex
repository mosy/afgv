A level transmitter needs to be installed in a process where the liquid density happens to change over time (anywhere from 55 lb/ft$^{3}$ to 58 lb/ft$^{3}$, unpredictably) and the vapor density also changes over time (anywhere from 0.041 lb/ft$^{3}$ to 0.061 lb/ft$^{3}$, unpredictably).  Determine whether or not each of the following level-sensing instruments would be appropriate for this application (i.e. whether or not each technology would yield reliable and reasonably accurate measurements of process level):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Guided-wave radar: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Ultrasonic (bottom-mounted): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Displacer: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\end{itemize}
