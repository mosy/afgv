A level transmitter needs to be installed in a process where the vapor density varies randomly from 0.031 lb/ft$^{3}$ to 0.055 lb/ft$^{3}$ but the liquid density remains constant at 68 lb/ft$^{3}$.  Determine whether or not each of the following level-sensing instruments would be appropriate for this application (i.e. whether or not each technology would yield reliable and reasonably accurate measurements of process level):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Displacer: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Guided-wave radar: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Hydrostatic: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\end{itemize}
