A FOUNDATION Fieldbus transmitter senses the level of fluid inside a fuel storage tank.  The operators need to see the volume of fuel stored inside the tank in units of {\it cubic feet}, while the level transmitter directly senses fuel level over a range of 0 to 14 feet.  The cylindrical tank has a radius of 2.5 feet (5 foot diameter).  Determine the proper {\tt L\_type}, {\tt XD\_Scale}, and {\tt OUT\_Scale} values to enter into this transmitter's Analog Input function block when configuring the system:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\tt L\_type} = Indirect
\item{} {\tt XD\_Scale} = 0 to 14 feet
\item{} {\tt OUT\_Scale} = 0 to 274.9 cubic feet
\end{itemize}
