Suppose a Rosemount model 3244MV (FOUNDATION Fieldbus) transmitter is used as a voltage sensor for a strain gauge bridge circuit, the transmitter configured to sense DC millivolt input and report the amount of strain in pounds of force.  The bridge circuit and strain gauge are designed to output 1.8 millivolts of signal per pound of applied force:

Determine the proper {\tt XD\_Scale}, {\tt OUT\_Scale}, and {\tt L\_Type} parameter values to make the transmitter functional over the strain gauge's range of 0 to 60 pounds.
