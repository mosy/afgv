Determine whether the following flowmeter technologies would be practical for a process fluid that is a {\it slurry} (a liquid with lots of hard solid particles suspended in it, such as fresh concrete).  Assume that all other properties of the fluid are favorable to these different flowmeter types:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Orifice flowmeter ({\it Yes} or {\it No})?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Positive displacement flowmeter ({\it Yes} or {\it No})?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Transit-time ultrasonic flowmeter ({\it Yes} or {\it No})?
\end{itemize}
