A dough-making process at an industrial bakery mixes hot water into an insulated vessel along with ground wheat flour.  Other ingredients are added to this mix, but flour and water are by far the largest constituents.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the final temperature of the dough, assuming the following quantities:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Mixing vessel is made of steel ($c$ = 0.12 BTU/lb-$^{o}$F) weighing 22 pounds, initially at 60 $^{o}$F
\vskip 10pt
\item{} 75 pounds of wheat flour ($c$ = 0.43 BTU/lb-$^{o}$F), initially at 60 $^{o}$F
\vskip 10pt
\item{} 180 pounds of water ($c$ = 1.0 BTU/lb-$^{o}$F), initially at 120 $^{o}$F
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Sensible heat lost by the water as it cools to the final temperature will be equal to the sensible heat gained by both the steel vessel and the wheat flour:

$$Q_{water-lost} = Q_{wheat-gained} + Q_{steel-gained}$$

$$m_{water}c_{water} (120 - T) = m_{wheat}c_{wheat} (T - 60) + m_{steel}c_{steel} (T - 60)$$

$$(180)(1)(120 - T) = (75)(0.43)(T - 60) + (22)(0.12)(T - 60)$$

$$(180)(120 - T) = (32.25)(T - 60) + (2.64)(T - 60)$$

$$(180)(120 - T) = (32.25 + 2.64)(T - 60)$$

$$(180)(120 - T) = (34.89)(T - 60)$$

$${(180)(120 - T) \over 34.89} = T - 60$$

$${21600 - 180 T \over 34.89} = T - 60$$

$$619.09 - 5.16 T = T - 60$$

$$679.09 = 6.16 T$$

$$T = {679.09 \over 6.16} = 110.26^o \hbox{F}$$
