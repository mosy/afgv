\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify and sketch a calibration error other than the three represented here.
\item{} For each of the calibration errors shown, identify whether the error would be {\it positive} or {\it negative} in sign.
\item{} Explain how you may interpret any of these errors by inspection of tabulated numbers (i.e. without the benefit of a visual graph).  What numerical patterns, specifically, would you look for when identifying a zero error, or a span error, or any other type of calibration error?
\end{itemize}
