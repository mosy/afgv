A ``communicator'' is a useful device when calibrating a ``smart'' transmitter because it:

\begin{itemize}
\item{(A)} Measures electrical loop resistance to indicate poor connections
\vskip 5pt 
\item{(B)} Gives you access to change the LRV and URV settings of the transmitter
\vskip 5pt 
\item{(C)} Calibrates the transmitter all by itself
\vskip 5pt 
\item{(D)} Provides full diagnostic information that is never incorrect or misleading
\vskip 5pt 
\item{(E)} Eliminates the need for calibration standard devices
\end{itemize}
