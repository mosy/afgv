\item{(A)} Calibrates the transmitter all by itself
\vskip 5pt 
\item{(B)} Measures electrical loop resistance to indicate poor connections
\vskip 5pt 
\item{(C)} Gives you access to change the LRV and URV settings of the transmitter
\vskip 5pt 
\item{(D)} Eliminates the need for calibration standard devices
\vskip 5pt 
\item{(E)} Provides full diagnostic information that is never incorrect or misleading
\end{itemize}
