Determine the statuses of all lamps and relay coils in this circuit, given the following process conditions:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01089x01.eps}$$

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Flow = 7.9 GPM
\item{} Pressure = 36 PSI
\item{} Temperature = 210 $^{o}$F
\item{} Level = 7.1 ft
\item{} Pushbutton A = {\it pressed}
\item{} Pushbutton B = {\it unpressed}
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Fully annotated circuit schematic:}  {\it ``X'' representing an open contact or de-energized load, and ``'' representing a closed contact or energized load}

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01089x02.eps}$$

Recall that a process switch will be in its resting (``normal'') condition when the stimulus value is less than the trip threshold, and will be in its actuated condition when the stimulus exceeds the threshold.

\vskip 10pt

Therefore,
 
\begin{itemize}
\item{} CR1 coil = {\bf de-energized}
\item{} Blue lamp = {\bf de-energized}
\item{} Red lamp = {\bf energized}
\item{} Amber lamp = {\bf energized} 
\end{itemize}
