Determine whether the following flowmeter technologies would be practical for wood pulp, which consists mostly of hot water mixed with starch and bits of wood, the size of those bits ranging from chips to dust to long fibrous strings.  Assume that all other properties of the wood pulp are favorable to these different flowmeter types:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Transit-time ultrasonic ({\it Yes} or {\it No})?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Turbine flowmeter ({\it Yes} or {\it No})?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Magnetic flowmeter ({\it Yes} or {\it No})?
\end{itemize}
