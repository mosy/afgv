A level transmitter needs to be installed in a process where the liquid is so corrosive that any metal object touching it will become dissolved.  The storage vessel is made of fiberglass instead of metal, and all piping and valves are of plastic construction.  Determine whether or not each of the following level-sensing instruments would be appropriate for this application (i.e. whether or not each technology would yield reliable and reasonably accurate measurements of process level):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Guided-wave radar: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Hydrostatic (bubble tube): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Weight (load cells): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\end{itemize}
