A level transmitter needs to be installed in a process where a substantial thickness of dense foam (approximately one-twentieth the density of the liquid) collects on the liquid surface.  The transmitter needs to sense the level of the liquid only, and not the foam.  Determine whether or not each of the following level-sensing instruments would be appropriate for this application (i.e. whether or not each technology would yield reliable and reasonably accurate measurements of process level):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Tape and float: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Ultrasonic (top-mounted): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Ultrasonic (bottom-mounted): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\end{itemize}
