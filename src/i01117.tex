This pictorial diagram shows the wiring connections for a simple pressure control loop, where a loop-powered 4-20 mA pressure transmitter sends a signal to a Honeywell controller, which in turn sends another 4-20 mA signal to a control valve:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01117x01.eps}$$

If an operator informs you that the pressure indicated by the Honeywell controller is above range (``pegged'' full upscale, reading +110\%), what types and locations of electrical faults might you suspect?  Are there any non-electrical faults which might also cause this to happen?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If the Honeywell controller is pegged upscale, it means the analog input is receiving too much voltage.  A failed-open resistor would do this, as would any short-circuit bypassing the transmitter.

No fault in the valve (output) circuit would have any effect on the controller's indication of pressure, since the valve control circuit is independent of the transmitter circuit.
