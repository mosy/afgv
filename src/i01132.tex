When the 5 k$\Omega$ potentiometer in this circuit is set to its 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\% positions, the following output voltages are obtained (measured with respect to ground, of course):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01132x01.eps}$$

\begin{itemize}
\item{} At 0\% setting, $V_{out} = 0 \hbox{ V}$
\item{} At 25\% setting, $V_{out} = 2.5 \hbox{ V}$
\item{} At 50\% setting, $V_{out} = 5 \hbox{ V}$
\item{} At 75\% setting, $V_{out} = 7.5 \hbox{ V}$
\item{} At 100\% setting, $V_{out} = 10 \hbox{ V}$
\end{itemize}

Calculate what the output voltages will be if a 1 k$\Omega$ load resistor is connected between the ``$V_{out}$'' terminal and ground:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} At 0\% setting, $V_{out} = $
\item{} At 25\% setting, $V_{out} = $
\item{} At 50\% setting, $V_{out} = $
\item{} At 75\% setting, $V_{out} = $
\item{} At 100\% setting, $V_{out} = $
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\item{} At 0\% setting, $V_{out} = 0 \hbox{ V}$
\item{} At 25\% setting, $V_{out} = 1.29 \hbox{ V}$
\item{} At 50\% setting, $V_{out} = 2.22 \hbox{ V}$
\item{} At 75\% setting, $V_{out} = 3.87 \hbox{ V}$
\item{} At 100\% setting, $V_{out} = 10 \hbox{ V}$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is really nothing more than five loaded voltage divider problems packed into one!  It is a very practical question, as potentiometers are very often used as variable voltage dividers, and students must realize the effects a load resistance will have on the characteristics of such dividers.  Point out to them the extreme nonlinearity created by the inclusion of the load resistance.
