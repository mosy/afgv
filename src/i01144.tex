This override control system protects the diesel engine/generator from overheating under conditions where there is a high demand for electrical power in the grid:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01144x01.eps}$$

Complete the following table of signal values for this system, assuming the temperature transmitter has failed high (20 mA all the time) and that this condition has persisted for a few hours.  Assume a measurement range of 0 to 17,000 volts for ET-35 and a measurement range of 0 to 250 degrees for TT-41.  Note that there are ranges of correct answers here -- all I'm looking for is a set of values that would be realistic:

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

{\it 3 points for TIC PV being exactly equal to 250 deg F; 3 points for EIC PV being less than 13,800 volts; 4 points for EIC output being much greater than TIC output.}

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

{\it Deduct 2 points for any answer that is absurd.  For example, saying the engine temperature is 1000 degrees F, or that the line voltage is 0 volts.}
