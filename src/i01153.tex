Interpret the pressure measurement displayed by this gauge mechanism, assuming a gauge accuracy of $\pm$ 2\% full scale:

$$\epsfxsize=6in \includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01153x01.eps}$$

How low and how high could this pressure actually be, given the stated accuracy of this gauge?

\underbar{file i01153}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Pressure = 7800 PSI $\pm$ 400 PSI
 
\vskip 10pt

This means the actual pressure could be as low as 7400 PSI or as high as 8200 PSI.
