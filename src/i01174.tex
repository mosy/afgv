The probability calculation for a logical two-input OR function follows this formula, where $A$ and $B$ are probability values ranging between 0 and 1 inclusive:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01174x01.eps}$$

$$\hbox{Two-input OR function probability} = A + B - AB$$

Derive a probability value formula for a {\it three-input} logical OR function:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

We may use DeMorgan's Theorem to translate the three-input OR gate into a three-input AND gate with inverted inputs and outputs, then express the probability values accordingly:
 
$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01174x03.eps}$$

$$\hbox{Three-input OR function probability} = 1 - [(1 - A)(1 - B)(1 - C)]$$

$$\hbox{Three-input OR function probability} = 1 - [(1 - B - A + AB)(1 - C)]$$

$$\hbox{Three-input OR function probability} = 1 - [1 - C - B + BC - A + AC + AB - ABC]$$

$$\hbox{Three-input OR function probability} = 1 - 1 + C + B - BC + A - AC - AB + ABC$$

$$\hbox{Three-input OR function probability} = A + B + C - AB - BC - AC + ABC$$
