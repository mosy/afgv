A three-phase electric motor operating at a line voltage of 4160 volts AC (RMS) draws 27.5 amps of current (RMS) through each of its lines.  Calculate the amount of apparent power consumed by this motor.

\vskip 10pt

Assuming the motor is 92\% efficient and operating at a power factor of 1, calculate its mechanical output power in the unit of horsepower.
