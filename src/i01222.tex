Suppose a FOUNDATION Fieldbus pressure transmitter is connected to the hydraulic line supplying fluid pressure to a ram, for the purpose of measuring the ram's exerted force based on sensed pressure.  Recall that the relationship between force and fluid pressure for a piston is $F = PA$, where $F$ is force in pounds, $A$ is surface area of the piston in square inches, and $P$ is fluid pressure in PSI.  Recall as well that the area for a circular object is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$.

\vskip 10pt

Supposing the ram's piston has a diameter of exactly 2 inches, determine the proper configuration parameters for this Fieldbus instrument's Analog Input (AI) block, assuming we wish this transmitter to report ram force over a range of 0 to 4700 pounds.
