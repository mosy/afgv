An instrument technician performs an ``RF link budget'' calculation before ordering equipment for a radio data system, to make sure there will be a strong enough signal for the system will perform well.  In doing this calculation, the technician does not include any {\it fade margin} in the calculation.  When asked why by another technician, the first technician says, ``The path between these radio units is a wide-open field, with no obstructions or any other large objects which could cause fade, therefore we don't need to consider a margin for fade.''

Do you agree with the first technician's reasoning that a wide-open field poses no risk of fade?  Explain why or why not.

We may experience fade if ever a large piece of machinery (e.g. a crane) is ever moved into this field, or even if we experience adverse weather conditions such as snow, sleet, or heavy rain.
