%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Any liquid- or solid-level control process would be appropriate, where level holds steady if in-flow = out-flow.  Other acceptable answers include any process where a precise ratio of mass flows in must be achieved in order to maintain some product variable at setpoint (e.g. chemical reaction control).
