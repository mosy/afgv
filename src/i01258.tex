Suppose a power system were delivering AC power to a resistive load drawing 150 amps:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01258x01.eps}$$

Calculate the load voltage, load power dissipation, the power dissipated by the wire resistance ($R_{wire}$), and the overall power efficiency ($\eta = {P_{load} \over P_{source}}$).

\begin{itemize}
\item {} $E_{load} = $ 
\item {} $P_{load} = $ 
\item {} $P_{lines} = $ 
\item {} $\eta = $ 
\bigskip

Now, suppose we were to use a pair of perfectly efficient 10:1 transformers to step the voltage up for transmission, and back down again for use at the load.  Re-calculate the load voltage, load power, wasted power, and overall efficiency of this system:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01258x02.eps}$$

\begin{itemize}
\item {} $E_{load} = $ 
\item {} $P_{load} = $ 
\item {} $P_{lines} = $ 
\item {} $\eta = $ 
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Simple system (no transformers):

\begin{itemize}
\item {} $E_{load} = 210$ volts
\item {} $P_{load} = 31.5$ kW
\item {} $P_{lines} = 4.5$ kW
\item {} $\eta = 87.5 \%$ 
\bigskip

Complex system (with transformers):

\begin{itemize}
\item {} $E_{load} = 239.7$ volts
\item {} $P_{load} = 35.96$ kW
\item {} $P_{lines} = 45$ W
\item {} $\eta = 99.88 \%$ 
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

An example like this usually clarifies the benefits of using AC instead of DC for transmission of large amounts of electrical power over substantial distances, better than simply telling students why transformers are used in power systems.  Even with modest power losses in the transformers (say, 3\% loss in each), the overall efficiency is still much greater in this system than without using transformers at all.

In discussing the follow-up question, be sure to bring up safety as a consideration if none of your students do.
