%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The purpose of FFC-41 is to control the flow of 600 PSI steam to the bottoms reboiler (heat exchanger E-9) in accordance with the feed flow rate in.  The feed flow is therefore the ``wild'' flow and the steam flow is the ``captive'' flow.  The ratio of steam flow to feed flow is automatically adjusted by AIT-42 sensing something about the composition of the bottoms product (perhaps density, or boiling point, or some other property related to the distillation of products within the tower).

This question is a good candidate for a ``Virtual Troubleshooting'' exercise.  Presenting the diagram to students, you first imagine in your own mind a particular fault in the system.  Then, you present one or more symptoms of that fault (something noticeable by an operator or other user of the system).  Students then propose various diagnostic tests to perform on this system to identify the nature and location of the fault, as though they were technicians trying to troubleshoot the problem.  Your job is to tell them what the result(s) would be for each of the proposed diagnostic tests, documenting those results where all the students can see.

During and after the exercise, it is good to ask students follow-up questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What does the result of the last diagnostic test tell you about the fault?
\item{} Suppose the results of the last diagnostic test were different.  What then would that result tell you about the fault?
\item{} Is the last diagnostic test the best one we could do?
\item{} What would be the ideal order of tests, to diagnose the problem in as few steps as possible?
\end{itemize}
