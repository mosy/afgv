The loss of signal power for a radio wave propagating outward in space is given by the following formula, where $L_p$ is the ``path loss'' in decibels, $D$ is the distance traveled by the radio wave, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of that wave:
 
$$L_p = -20 \log \left({4 \pi D \over \lambda}\right)$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $D$:
