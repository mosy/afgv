The loss of signal power for a radio wave propagating outward in space is given by the following formula, where $L_p$ is the ``path loss'' in decibels, $D$ is the distance traveled by the radio wave, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of that wave:
 
$$L_p = -20 \log \left({4 \pi D \over \lambda}\right)$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $\lambda$:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\lambda = {4 \pi D \over 10^{-{L_p \over 20}}} \hbox{\hskip 20pt or \hskip 20pt} \lambda = {4 \pi D 10^{L_p \over 20}}$$
