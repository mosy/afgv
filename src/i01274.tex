Suppose a turbine flowmeter registers a volumetric flow rate of 327 cubic feet per hour.  Convert this flow measurement into units of {\it gallons per minute}:

\vskip 10pt

327 ft$^{3}$/hr = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} GPM

\vskip 10pt

Next, supposing a densitometer measures the density of this fluid to be 53.9 pounds per cubic foot, calculate the mass flow rate in pounds per second:

\vskip 10pt

327 ft$^{3}$/hr = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} lbm/s

\underbar{file i01274}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

5 points for each answer:

\vskip 10pt

327 ft$^{3}$/hr = \underbar{\bf 40.769} GPM

327 ft$^{3}$/hr = \underbar{\bf 4.8959} lbm/s
