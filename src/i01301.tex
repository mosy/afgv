A very important concept in algebra is the {\it variable}.  What, exactly, is a variable, and why are they so useful to us?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\it Variables} are alphabetical letters used to represent numerical quantities.  Instead of writing numerical symbols (0, 1, -5, 2400, etc.), we may write letters ($a$, $b$, $c$, $x$, $y$, $z$), each of which representing a range of possible values.

While this concept may be confusing to some, especially at first, it is an extremely powerful mathematical technique.  It allows us to write {\it general} mathematical statements not restricted to one particular combination of numbers.
