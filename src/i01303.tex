Suppose we begin with this mathematical statement:

$$3 = 3$$

Not very stunning, I know, but nevertheless absolutely true in a mathematical sense.  If I were to add the quantity ``5'' to the left-hand side of the equation, though, the quantities on either side of the ``equals'' sign would no longer be equal to each other.  To be proper, I would have to replace the ``equals'' symbol with a ``not equal'' symbol:

$$3 + 5 \not = 3$$ 

Assuming that we keep ``$3 + 5$'' on the left-hand side of the statement, what would have to be done to the right-hand side of the statement to turn it into an equality again?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Without altering the left-hand side of this mathematical expression, the only way to bring both sides into equality again is to add the quantity ``5'' to the right-hand side as well:

$$3 + 5 = 3 + 5$$

One of the foundational principles of algebra is that any manipulation is allowed in an equation, so long as the same manipulation is applied to both sides.  This question introduces students to this principle in a very gentle way, using numerical values rather than variables.
