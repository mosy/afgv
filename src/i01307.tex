Suppose we were given the following equation:

$${14 \over y} = 2$$

What would the equation look like if both sides were multiplied by $y$?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$14 = 2y$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to show how a single operation, applied to both sides of the equation, will simplify its appearance, but fall short of isolating the variable $y$.  Encourage students to manipulate the resulting equation one more time to solve for $y$.
