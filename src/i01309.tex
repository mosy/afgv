Solve for $n$ in the following equations:

\vskip 20pt

Equation 1: $-56 = -14n$

\vskip 10pt

Equation 2: $54 - n = 10$

\vskip 10pt

Equation 3: ${4 \over n} = 12$

\vskip 10pt

Equation 4: $28 = 2 - n$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Equation 1: $n = 4$

\vskip 10pt

Equation 2: $n = 44$

\vskip 10pt

Equation 3: $n = 0.\overline{333}$

\vskip 10pt

Equation 4: $n = -26$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Equations 2 through 4 require two steps to solve for $n$.  Equation 1 only requires a single step, but the two negative numbers may be a bit confusing to some.
