A common equation used in physics relates the kinetic energy, velocity, and mass of a moving object:

$$E_k = {1 \over 2} m v^2$$

\noindent
Where,

$E_k =$ Kinetic energy (Joules)

$m =$ Mass (kilograms)

$v =$ Velocity (meters per second)

\vskip 10pt

Manipulate this equation as many times as necessary to express it in terms of all its variables.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$m = 2 {E_k \over v^2}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$v = \sqrt {2 {E_k \over m}}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The most challenging portion of this problem is solving for $v$, which involves ``undoing'' the exponent.
