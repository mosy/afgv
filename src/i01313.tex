The velocity necessary for a satellite to maintain a circular orbit around Earth is given by this equation:

$$v_s = \sqrt {g_c + h}$$

\noindent
Where,

$v_s =$ Satellite velocity (feet per second)

$g_c =$ Acceleration of Earth gravity at sea level (32 feet per second squared)

$h =$ Orbit altitude, (feet)

\vskip 10pt

Manipulate this equation to solve for $g_c$, and then to solve for $h$:

\vskip 10pt

$g_c$ =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$g_c = v_s^2 - h$$

\vskip 20pt

$$h = v_s^2 - g_c$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question challenges students to ``undo'' the square root before any isolation of $g_c$ or $h$ is done.
