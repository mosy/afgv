The expected operating life of a rolling-contact bearing may be predicted by the following equation:

$$R_L = \biggl( {C \over L} \biggr)^{10 \over 3}$$

\noindent
Where,

$R_L =$ Operating life (millions of shaft revolutions)

$C =$ Dynamic capacity of bearing (pounds)

$L =$ Radial load applied to bearing (pounds)

Manipulate this equation as many times as necessary to express it in terms of all its variables.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$C = L(R_L)^{3 \over 10}$$

$$L = {C \over (R_L)^{3 \over 10}}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question challenges students to ``move'' the ${10 \over 3}$ exponent from one side of the equation to the other before any isolation of $C$ or $L$ may be done.
