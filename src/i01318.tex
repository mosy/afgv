Manipulate this equation so that it is expressed in terms of $x$ (with all other variables and constants on the other side of the equals sign):

$$y = {3 \over 2x} - {7 \over 3y}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$x = {9y \over {6y^2 + 14}}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Several steps are required to solve for $x$ in this equation, beginning with manipulation of the fractional terms to arrive at common denominators, and factoring $x$ out of a polynomial expression in a later step.
