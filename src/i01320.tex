In machining production technology, the time required to ``broach'' a hole in a plate may be estimated by the following equation:

$$T = {L \over C} + {L \over R_c}$$

\noindent
Where,

$T =$ Time to broach hole (minutes)

$L =$ Length of stroke (feet)

$C =$ Cutting speed (feet per minute)

$R_c =$ Return speed (feet per minute)

Manipulate this equation as many times as necessary to express it in terms of all its variables.

A first step we'll need to do for all these manipulations is to combine the two fractions into one.  This is done by finding common denominators:

$$T = {L \over C} + {L \over R_c}$$

$$T = {L R_c \over C R_c} + {C L \over C R_c}$$

$$T = {{L R_c + C L} \over C R_c}$$

$$T = {{L (R_c + C)} \over C R_c}$$

From here, we may easily solve for $L$:

$$L = {{T C R_c} \over {R_c + C}} \hbox{\hskip 10pt . . . or . . . \hskip 10pt} L = {T \over {{1 \over C} + {1 \over R_c}}} $$

\vskip 20pt

We may solve for $C$ by beginning with this equation, then collecting all terms containing $C$ and factoring out $C$:

$$T = {{L R_c + C L} \over C R_c}$$

$$C R_c T = L R_c + C L$$

$$C R_c T - CL = L R_c$$

$$C (R_c T - L) = L R_c$$

$$C = {{L R_c} \over {R_c T} - L} \hbox{\hskip 10pt . . . or . . . \hskip 10pt} C = {L \over T - {L \over R_c}}$$

\vskip 20pt

We may solve for $R_c$ by beginning with this equation, then collecting all terms containing $R_c$ and factoring out $R_c$:

$$T = {{L R_c + C L} \over C R_c}$$

$$C R_c T = L R_c + C L$$

$$C R_c T - L R_c = C L$$

$$R_c (CT - L) = C L$$

$$R_c = {CL \over {CT - L}} \hbox{\hskip 10pt . . . or . . . \hskip 10pt} R_c = {L \over T - {L \over C}}$$
