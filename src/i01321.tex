The {\it Brinell hardness} of a metal specimen is measured by pressing a ball into the specimen and measuring the size of the resulting indentation.  To calculate Brinell hardness, this equation is used:

$$H = {F \over ({\pi d_1 \over 2}) ({d_1 - \sqrt{d_1^2 - d_s^2}})}$$

\noindent
Where,

$H =$ Hardness of specimen (Brinell units)

$F =$ Force on ball (kg)

$d_1 =$ Diameter of ball (mm)

$d_s =$ Diameter of indentation (mm)

\vskip 10pt

Manipulate this equation to solve for $F$ and for $d_s$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$F = H \Bigl({\pi d_1 \over 2}\Bigr) \Bigl({d_1 - \sqrt{d_1^2 - d_s^2}}\Bigr)$$

\vskip 20pt

$$d_s = \sqrt{d_1^2 - \Bigl( d_1 - {2F \over H \pi d_1} \Bigr)^2}$$
