This is the {\it Ideal Gas Law} equation, expressing the relationship between the pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), temperature ($T$), and molar quantity ($n$) of an enclosed gas:

$$PV = nRT$$

Manipulate this equation to solve for each of the following variables:

\vskip 10pt

$P =$

\vskip 10pt

$V =$

\vskip 10pt

$n =$

\vskip 10pt

$R =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$P = {nRT \over V}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$V = {nRT \over P}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$n = {PV \over RT}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$R = {PV \over nT}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$T = {PV \over nR}$$
