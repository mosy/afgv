The velocity of light (normally $c = 3 \times 10^8$ meters per second in a vacuum) slows down proportional to the square-root of the dielectric permittivity of whatever substance it passes through, as described by the following equation:

$$v = {c \over \sqrt{\epsilon}}$$

Manipulate this equation to solve for each of the following variables:

$c =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$c = v \sqrt{\epsilon}$$

$$\epsilon = \left({c \over v}\right)^2$$
