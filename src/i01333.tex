The electrical resistance of an RTD temperature sensor ($R$) is given by this equation as a function of its base resistance at a specified reference temperature ($R_0$), its coefficient of resistance ($\alpha$), its temperature ($T$), and the reference temperature ($T_{ref}$):

$$R = R_0 [1 + \alpha(T - T_{ref})]$$

Manipulate this equation to solve for each of the following variables:

\vskip 10pt

$R_0 =$

\vskip 10pt

$\alpha =$

\vskip 10pt

$T =$

\vskip 10pt

$T_{ref} =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$R_0 = {R \over {1 + \alpha(T - T_{ref})}}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$\alpha = {{{R \over R_0} - 1} \over {T - T_{ref}}}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$T = {{{R \over R_0} - 1} \over a} + T_{ref}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$T_{ref} = T - {{{R \over R_0} - 1} \over a}$$
