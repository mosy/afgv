Bernoulli's equation expresses the relationship between height, velocity, and pressure for a moving fluid.  This particular form of Bernoulli's equation uses mass density ($\rho$) as opposed to weight density ($\gamma$) to express how dense the fluid is:

$$z_1 \rho g + {v_1^2 \rho \over 2} + P_1 = z_2 \rho g + {v_2^2 \rho \over 2} + P_2$$

Knowing that mass and weight density are related to each other by the equation $\gamma = \rho g$, re-write Bernoulli's equation so that it does not contain $\rho$ anymore, but instead uses $\gamma$:

Re-write Bernoulli's equation one more time so that $\gamma$ appears only {\it once} on each side of the equation:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$z_1 \gamma + {v_1^2 \gamma \over 2g} + P_1 = z_2 \gamma + {v_2^2 \gamma \over 2g} + P_2$$

$$z_1 + {v_1^2 \over 2g} + {P_1 \over \gamma} = z_2 + {v_2^2 \over 2g} + {P_2 \over \gamma}$$
