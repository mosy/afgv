This is the {\it Nernst} equation, expressing the voltage developed across an ion-permeable membrane as ions migrate through:

$$V = {RT \over nF} \ln {C_1 \over C_2}$$

Manipulate this equation to solve for each of the following variables:

\vskip 10pt

$R =$

\vskip 10pt

$F =$

\vskip 10pt

$C_1 =$

\vskip 10pt

$C_2 =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$R = {VnF \over {T \ln {C_1 \over C_2}}}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$F = {RT \over nV} \ln {C_1 \over C_2}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$C_1 = C_2 e^{VnF \over RT}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$C_2 = {C_1 \over {e^{VnF \over RT}}} \hskip 10pt \hbox{ or } \hskip 10pt C_2 = C_1 e^{-{VnF \over RT}}$$
