This equation predicts the volumetric flow rate of liquid through a control valve ($Q$) given the flow coefficient for the valve ($C_v$), the upstream and downstream pressures ($P_1$ and $P_2$), and the specific gravity of the liquid ($G_f$):

$$Q = C_v \sqrt{P_1 - P_2 \over G_f}$$

Manipulate this equation to solve for each of the following variables:

\vskip 10pt

$C_v =$

\vskip 10pt

$P_1 =$

\vskip 10pt

$P_2 =$

\vskip 10pt

$G_f =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$C_v = {Q \over \sqrt{P_1 - P_2 \over G_f}}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$P_1 = {Q^2 G_f \over C_v^2} + P_2$$

\vskip 20pt

$$P_2 = P_1 - {Q^2 G_f \over C_v^2}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$G_f = {(P_1 - P_2) C^2 \over Q^2}$$
