This equation solves for the pressure recovery factor ($F_L$) of a control valve given pressures upstream ($P_1$), downstream ($P_2$), and at the vena contracta inside the valve ($P_{vc}$):

$$F_L = \sqrt{{P_1 - P_2} \over {P_1 - P_{vc}}}$$

Manipulate this equation to solve for each of the following variables:

\vskip 10pt

$P_1 =$

\vskip 10pt

$P_2 =$

\vskip 10pt

$P_{vc} =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$P_1 = {P_2 - P_{vc}F_L^2 \over 1 - F_L^2}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$P_2 = P_1 - F_L^2 (P_1 - P_{vc})$$

\vskip 20pt

$$P_{vc} = P_1 - {P_1 - P_2 \over F_L^2}$$
