This equation predicts the volumetric flow rate of gas through a control valve ($Q$) given the flow coefficient for the valve ($C_v$), the upstream and downstream pressures ($P_1$ and $P_2$), the temperature of the gas ($T$), and the specific gravity of the gas ($G_g$):

$$Q = 963 \> C_v \sqrt{{(P_1 - P_2) (P_1 + P_2)} \over {G_g T}}$$

Manipulate this equation to solve for each of the following variables:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$P_1 = \sqrt{ {Q^2 G_g T \over 927369 C_v^2} + P_2^2}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$P_2 = \sqrt{P_1^2 - {Q^2 G_g T \over 927369 C_v^2}}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$T = 927369 C_v^2 {P_1^2 - P_2^2 \over G_g Q^2}$$
