This equation predicts the path loss of a radio signal (in units of decibels) as it propagates away from a radiating antenna:

$$L_{path} = -20 \log \left(4 \pi D \over \lambda \right)$$

Manipulate this equation to solve for each of the following variables:

\vskip 10pt

$D =$

\vskip 10pt

$\lambda =$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$D = {\lambda 10^{-{L \over 20}} \over 4 \pi} \hskip 20pt \hbox{. . . or . . .} \hskip 20pt D = {\lambda \over 4 \pi 10^{L \over 20}}$$

\vskip 20pt

$$\lambda = {4 \pi D \over 10^{-{L \over 20}}} \hskip 20pt \hbox{. . . or . . .} \hskip 20pt \lambda = 4 \pi D 10^{L \over 20}$$
