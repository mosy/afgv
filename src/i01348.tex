This solar-powered pump system has a problem.  The pump motor is supposed to turn on according to a timed schedule set by the timer switch, yet the pump never comes on even when the sun is shining fully on the electricity-generating solar panels.  Each panel generates 22 volts when open-circuited (i.e. no load) and 15 volts when driving the pump motor:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01348x01.eps}$$

A DC voltmeter connected between terminals 8 and 1 registers 66 volts when the sun is shining brightly and the timer switch is supposed to be in its ``on'' state to run the pump.  Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.
