If a control valve has a C$_{v}$ rating of 170, how much gasoline (D = 42 lb/ft$^{3}$) will flow through it in a wide-open condition given a differential pressure of 8 PSI?

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} If water were substituted for gasoline, but all other factors remained the same, would the flow rate increase, decrease, or remain the same?
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$$Q = C_v \sqrt{\Delta P \over G_f}$$

$$Q = 170 \sqrt{8 \over {42 \over 62.4}} = 586.1 \hbox{ GPM}$$
