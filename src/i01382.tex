\begin{itemize}
\item{} The most important aspect of your answer to this question, as usual, is {\it how} and {\it why} you arrived at your selections.  Explain how you know are able to tell each of these valves' characteristics just from the appearance of the trim cross-sections.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Identifying linear, equal percentage, and quick opening trim shapes is relatively simple if you have the three different trims side-by-side for comparison.  I like to call this the ``Goldilocks'' method: identifying which is which by comparing their relative shapes one to another.  Linear will be the trim shape that is ``in between'' the two extremes of equal percentage and quick opening.

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01382x02.eps}$$
 
The {\it quick opening} valve should be obvious: it opens up rapidly as the plug moves up off the seat, since the plug does not actually penetrate the ``throat'' of the seat at all, unlike the other trim types.

\vskip 10pt

The bottom valve is {\it linear}, having a nearly perfect cone-shaped plug penetrating through the throat of the seat.  This produces a $C_v$ that varies linearly with plug travel.

\vskip 10pt

The {\it equal percentage} valve is in the upper-left.  Its plug has a much steeper (more vertical) pitch than the linear plug, making its $C_v$ increase at a slower rate at first, but then the plug becomes flatter toward the bottom, making the $C_v$ increase at a more rapid rate toward the end of plug travel.
