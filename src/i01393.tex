%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Any industrial example of rates-of-change (over time) or of relating one dependent variable's change to some other independent variable.  Examples include but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Flow measurement inferred from change in volume or mass over time
\item{} Pipeline pressure rate-of-change detection
\item{} Furnace temperature rate-of-change measurement
\item{} ``D'' action in a PID controller
\end{itemize}

Award only half-credit if the example is not industrial in nature (calculating speed of a vehicle given its position over time).  Award no credit if the example is not quantitative (i.e. if it lacks number values).
