While performing an ``As-Found'' analysis on a control valve equipped with a smart positioner, an instrument technician records this unusual valve signature:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01424x01.eps}$$

What is your diagnosis of this valve signature?  What physical problem(s) should the technician begin to look for when examining the valve?

\begin{itemize}
\item{} A useful problem-solving technique to apply to any scenario with a graph is to let the graph ``tell you'' what is happening step-by-step in time as you follow it from one extreme to the other.  Try doing this: starting at the lower-left corner, following the upper (red) trace step by step as though you are re-playing the opening of the valve over time, interpreting the graph in terms of stem position and actuator pressure (applied force).  Describe what the graph ``tells'' you as you follow it from one end to the other.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This valve clearly experiences more friction as the plug nears the seat.  If this is a cage-guided globe valve, I would suggest looking for interference between the piston and cage resulting from mis-alignment of the parts or poor machining.  Another possibility is stem friction against the packing at that same (nearly-closed to closed) position.
