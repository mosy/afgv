Graph the output of this proportional-only controller, assuming a proportional band value of 100\% and a control action that is direct-acting:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01484x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file i01484}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01484x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

With a proportional band value of 100\%, the gain will be equal to 1.
