One of the first, and most fundamental, concepts you learn in calculus is something called the {\it derivative}.  A ``derivative'' is an expression of the {\it rate of change} of two related variables, one of those variables often (but not always!) being {\it time}.

An example that everyone can relate to is {\it position} versus {\it speed} for an object.  Speed, we say, is the {\it derivative} of position with respect to time.  Using $v$ to represent an object's speed, $x$ to represent an object's position, and $t$ to represent time, we may write express this calculus relationship as such:

$$v = {dx \over dt}$$

In the following list of variables, determine which is the derivative of which, and express each relationship in the same form that you see here for speed, position, and time (one variable equal to a quotient of differentials).

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Mass of radioactive substance ($m$), decay rate ($r$), and time ($t$)
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} Liquid volume ($V$), liquid flow ($Q$), and time ($t$)
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} Speed ($v$), acceleration ($a$), and time ($t$)
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} Work ($W$), power ($P$), and time ($t$)
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} Voltage ($V$), current ($I$), and incremental resistance ($R$)
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} Magnetizing force ($H$), magnetic flux density ($B$), and permeability ($\mu$)
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} Cost ($C$) to manufacture items, number of items ($x$), and marginal cost ($C'$)
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Note: for each of these, it may help to sketch a graph showing how two of the three variables normally relate to each other.
