Estimate the slopes of the tangent lines touching a nonlinear function ($y = x^3$) at $x=1$, $x=2$, $x=3$, $x=4$, and $x=5$ by using secant line approximations:

\vskip 10pt

$$\hbox{If } y = x^3 \hbox{ then,}$$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=1} = $$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=2} = $$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=3} = $$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=4} = $$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=5} = $$

\vskip 20pt

Do you see a mathematical relationship between the value of $x$ and the slope of the line tangent to that point on the cubic function?  Can you express that relationship as a function of $x$?

$${dy \over dx} = \hbox{ ???}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=1} = 3$$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=2} = 12$$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=3} = 27$$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=4} = 48$$

\vskip 20pt

$${{dy \over dx} \bigg|} _ {x=5} = 75$$

\vskip 20pt

$${dy \over dx} = 3x^2$$
