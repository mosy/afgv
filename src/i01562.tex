\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify practical applications in industry for circuits such as these.
\item{} Explain how each of these circuits would respond to a square-wave input signal of constant frequency.
\item{} Explain how each of these circuits would respond to a square-wave input signal of increasing frequency.
\item{} Explain what would happen if the output of the integrator were connected to the input of the differentiator, and then a signal was input to the integrator.  What kind of signal would come out of the differentiator?
\item{} Explain what would happen if the output of the differentiator were connected to the input of the integrator, and then a signal was input to the differentiator.  What kind of signal would come out of the integrator?

Ask your students to frame their answers in a practical context, such as speed and distance for a moving object (where speed is the time-derivative of distance and distance is the time-integral of speed).
