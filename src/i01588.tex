Some processes may be controlled by an automatic controller only having {\it integral} control action.  Here is a schematic diagram of one such controller:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01588x01.eps}$$

Examine this schematic diagram and then answer the following questions about it:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Show where ``error'' is calculated in the circuit
\item{} Determine whether this is a direct-acting controller or a reverse-acting controller
\item{} Identify how to {\it decrease} the integration time constant ($\tau_i$); i.e. how to {\it increase} the aggressiveness of integral action
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} If used to control a real process, would this controller suffer from {\it offset} like a proportional-only controller would?  Explain why or why not?
\item{} Identify the effects of the feedback wire in module 2 failing open.
\item{} Identify the effects of the lower-left resistor in module 3 failing open.
\item{} Identify the effects of the upper-left resistor in module 3 failing open.
\item{} Identify the effects of the lower-right resistor in module 3 failing open.
\item{} Identify the effects of the upper-right resistor in module 3 failing open.
\item{} Identify the effects of the capacitor in module 4 failing shorted.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Show where ``error'' is calculated in the circuit: {\bf At the output of the differential amplifier circuit (module 3)}
\item{} Determine whether this is a direct-acting controller or a reverse-acting controller: {\bf Reverse-acting}
\item{} Identify how to {\it decrease} the integration time constant ($\tau_i$); i.e. how to {\it increase} the aggressiveness of integral action: {\bf Smaller capacitor in module 4, lesser potentiometer setting in module 4, increased differential voltage gain in module 3}
\end{itemize}
