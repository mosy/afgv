Suppose an aging controller needs to be replaced, and its tuning constants are documented as such:

\begin{itemize}
\item{}Proportional band = 130\%
\vskip 5pt
\item{}Reset = 2.7 minutes per repeat
\end{itemize} 

The new controller destined to replace this old unit is also a proportional+integral controller, but its tuning constant units are different.  Instead of ``proportional band,'' the K$_{p}$ constant is labeled as ``gain.''  Instead of ``minutes per repeat,'' the new controller bears the unit of ``repeats per second'' for its integral constant.  

Convert the old tuning constants into the new units, so that when the new controller is installed, it does the same exact job as the old controller.  Note: assume the use of the same algorithm type (P+I equation) in both controllers.

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Explain what would happen if the new controller were installed and programmed (by someone who didn't know better) with a gain of 1.30 for proportional action and 2.7 repeats per second for integral action.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Gain = 0.769
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Reset = 0.00617 repeats per second
\end{itemize} 

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$$\hbox{Gain} = {1 \over \hbox{Proportional Band}} = {1 \over 130\%} = 0.769$$

\vskip 10pt

$$\left(1 \hbox{ rpt} \over 2.7 \hbox{ min}\right) \left(1 \hbox{ min} \over 60 \hbox{ sec}\right) = 0.00617 \hbox{ rpt/sec}$$
