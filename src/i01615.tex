Read the ``LabVIEW exercise \#2'' tutorial document in preparation for implementing it in the computer lab, in conjunction with a USB-based data acquisition unit.  Here, you will learn how to scale an analog input and also implement a comparison function to create an alarm function for a simulated water-level measurement system.
