This pneumatically-actuated globe valve assembly is comprised of a pneumatic actuator joined to a globe control valve.  It is very important for proper valve operation to correctly set the ``travel'' on the valve, so the plug moves exactly as far as the travel indicator's range, no more and no less.  The control valve assembly below has properly set stem travel -- full travel exactly matches the 0\% and 100\% marks on the travel indicator.

Explain {\it in detail} what could cause a control valve assembly to have too little stem travel, and identify what operational problem(s) may result from insufficient travel.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify in the illustrations exactly where the valve stem's motion will be ``blocked'' from being able to move freely, given the cause you identify for insufficient stem travel.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Insufficient valve travel is caused by the stem connector being set such that either the actuator and valve stems are too close together or they are too far apart.

\vskip 10pt

\hskip 30pt If the stems are connected too close together, the valve will not close fully.

\vskip 10pt

\hskip 30pt If the stems are connected too far apart, the valve will not open fully.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is what happens when the valve and actuator stems are coupled too far apart (i.e. total stem length is excessive):
