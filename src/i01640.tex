Determine how each control action (P, I, and D) would react during the periods marked on this process trend by using the symbols $\uparrow$ (driving up), $\downarrow$ (driving down), $+$ (steady positive), $-$ (steady negative) or 0 (zero), compared to the actions of each at the beginning of the trend.  Do this for P, as well as for I and D.  Assume {\it direct action} for the controller.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

{\bf Period 1:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{}P is zero, because error is unchanging
\item{}I is zero, because error is zero
\item{}D is zero, because error is unchanging
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 


{\bf Period 2:}
 
\begin{itemize}
\item{}P is increasing, because error is becoming more positive
\item{}I is increasing, because error is positive
\item{}D is positive, because rate of error change is steady and positive
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 


{\bf Period 3:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{}P is decreasing, because error is becoming more negative
\item{}I is increasing, because error is positive
\item{}D is negative, because rate of error change is steady and negative
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 

{\bf Period 4:}
 

\begin{itemize}
\item{}P is zero, because error is zero and unchanging
\item{}I is positive, because error is zero and integral has previously accumulated a positive value
\item{}D is zero, because error is unchanging
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 

{\bf Period 5:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{}P is decreasing, because error is becoming more negative
\item{}I is decreasing, because error is negative
\item{}D is negative, because rate of error change is steady and negative
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 

{\bf Period 6:}
 

\begin{itemize}
\item{}P is negative, because error is steady and negative
\item{}I is decreasing, because error is negative
\item{}D is zero, because error is unchanging
\end{itemize}
