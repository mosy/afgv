Determine how each control action (P, I, and D) would react during the periods marked on this process trend by using the symbols $\uparrow$ (driving up), $\downarrow$ (driving down), $+$ (positive), $-$ (negative) or 0 (zero), compared to the actions of each at the beginning of the trend.  Do this for P, as well as for I and D.  Assume {\it direct action} for the controller.

{\bf Period 1:}
 

\medskip 
\item{}P is decreasing, because error is becoming more negative
\item{}I is decreasing, because error is negative
\item{}D is negative, because rate of error change is negative
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 

{\bf Period 2:}
 

\medskip 
\item{}P is increasing, because error is becoming more positive
\item{}I is decreasing, because error is negative
\item{}D is positive, because rate of error change is positive
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 

{\bf Period 3:}
 

\medskip 
\item{}P is increasing, because error is becoming more positive
\item{}I is increasing, because error is positive
\item{}D is positive, because rate of error change is positive
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 

{\bf Period 4:}
 

\medskip 
\item{}P is decreasing, because error is becoming more negative
\item{}I is increasing, because error is positive
\item{}D is negative, because rate of error change is negative
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 

{\bf Period 5:}
 

\medskip 
\item{}P is decreasing, because error is becoming more negative
\item{}I is decreasing, because error is negative
\item{}D is negative, because rate of error change is negative
\end{itemize} 
\bigskip 
 

{\bf Period 6:}
 

\medskip 
\item{}P is negative, because error is steady and negative
\item{}I is decreasing, because error is negative
\item{}D is zero, because error is unchanging
\end{itemize}
