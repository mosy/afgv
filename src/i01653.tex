Suppose you were configuring a PID controller in preparation for tuning the PID constants, and desired to set the gain to a value of 1 and the other control actions (I and D) to minimum effect.  Identify appropriate numerical values to enter for each of these constants, assuming the following units:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Proportional = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \% proportional band
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Reset = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} minutes per repeat
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Rate = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} minutes
\end{itemize}

\underbar{file i01653}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Proportional = \underbar{100} \% proportional band
\item{} Reset = \underbar{(largest possible value)} minutes per repeat
\item{} Rate = \underbar{0} minutes
\end{itemize}
