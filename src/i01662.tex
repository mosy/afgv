Suppose you see this process response following a manual ``step-change'' in the output (final control element):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01662x01.eps}$$

Is this process inherently {\it self-regulating}, or {\it integrating}?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it self-regulating} process.  We know this because the process variable (PV) quickly reaches a point of equilibrium following a perturbation of the controller output.
