In a simple resistor-capacitor circuit, what is the definition of the term {\it time constant}?  For example, what does it mean to say that an RC circuit has a ``time constant'' of 3 seconds?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The time constant of an RC circuit is the amount of time it takes for voltage or current in the circuit to change by 63.2\% from its initial (starting) value to its ultimate (final) value.  In an RC circuit, the time constant ($\tau$) may be calculated by multiplying resistance in ohms by capacitance in Farads, for an answer in units of seconds.
