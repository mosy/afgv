What does it mean for a process (such as a temperature-controlled cookie oven) to have a {\it time constant}?  I am referring here to the process itself (oven, heating element, and cookies), not the control system.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The time constant of a process is the amount of time it takes for the process variable to change by 63.2\% from its initial value to its ultimate value, following a ``step-change'' in the final control element or any ``load'' in the process affecting the measured variable.
