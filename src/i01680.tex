%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A second-order process is essentially two first-order processes in sequence: it has two modes of energy/mass storage and two ``resistances,'' leading to a response that is more sluggish than a first-order process.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Adding one first-order process to another first-order process does not merely increase the time constant, but actually changes the shape of the response curve over time.
