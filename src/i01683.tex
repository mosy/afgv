Most processes may be characterized as either {\it integrating}, {\it self-regulating}, or some combination of the two.  However, there are processes whose characteristic is better described as {\it runaway}.  Describe what a ``runaway'' process is, and give an example of it if you can.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The classic example of a ``runaway'' process is position control on an {\it inverted pendulum} mechanism.  I will let you research what an ``inverted pendulum'' is and describe for yourself what characterizes a runaway process.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some chemical reactions are runaway, especially exothermic reactions in the presence of (essentially) unlimited reactant.
