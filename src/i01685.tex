Suppose this current-to-pressure (I/P) transducer's orifice (restriction) suddenly and completely plugs up with debris:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01685x01.eps}$$

\noindent
Choose the best answer to describe the effects of this fault:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} The output pressure will decrease slightly 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} There will be no effect whatsoever -- all will continue as normal
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The output pressure will fall all the way to zero PSI
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The output pressure will increase slightly 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The output pressure will rise all the way to full supply PSI 
\end{itemize}
