This liquid level control system works adequately, but not as good as it could.  In its present form, the liquid level in the accumulator tends to be affected by variations in surge tank level, because this affects the differential pressure drop across the control valve, and thus the flow rate exiting the accumlator for any given control valve position:

Modify this system for better control of accumulator liquid level.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Add a (cascaded) flow controller to the liquid outlet pipe, and have the level indicating controller (LIC) send the flow controller (FC) a setpoint.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: after making this modification, is the level control process of inherently {\it self-regulating}, or inherently {\it integrating}?  Explain your answer.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Add a (cascaded) flow controller to the liquid outlet pipe, and have the level indicating controller (LIC) send the flow controller (FC) a setpoint.  This way, changes in outlet flow resulting from variations in the valve's downstream pressure will be immediately corrected by the slave (flow) controller before any effect is seen on the master (level) loop.

$$\epsfbox{i01696x02.eps}$$

After installing the slave flow control loop, the level control will be perfectly integrating!
