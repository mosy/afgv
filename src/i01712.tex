$$Q = C_v \sqrt{\Delta P \over G_f}$$

\noindent
Where,

$Q$ = Liquid flow rate, in units of gallons per minute (GPM)

$C_v$ = Valve capacity coefficient

$\Delta P$ = Pressure dropped across valve, pounds per square inch differential (PSID)

$G_f$ = Specific gravity of liquid (Water at standard temperature and pressure = 1.0)

$$Q = 963 \> C_v \sqrt{{\Delta P (P_1 + P_2)} \over {G_g T}}$$

\noindent
Where,

$Q$ = Gas flow rate, in units of Standard Cubic Feet per Hour (SCFH)

$C_v$ = Valve capacity coefficient

$\Delta P$ = Pressure dropped across valve, pounds per square inch differential (PSID)

$P_1$ = Upstream valve pressure, pounds per square inch absolute (PSIA)

$P_2$ = Downstream valve pressure, pounds per square inch absolute (PSIA)

$G_g$ = Specific gravity of gas (Air at standard temperature and pressure = 1.0)

$T$ = Absolute temperature of gas in degrees Rankine ($^{o}$R) = $^{o}$F + 459.67

$$F_L = \sqrt{{P_1 - P_2} \over {P_1 - P_{vc}}}$$
 
\noindent
Where,

$F_L$ = Pressure recovery factor, unitless

$P_1$ = Upstream valve pressure, pounds per square inch absolute (PSIA)

$P_2$ = Downstream valve pressure, pounds per square inch absolute (PSIA)

$P_{vc}$ = Pressure at {\it vena contracta} of flow stream
