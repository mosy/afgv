Determine the directions of electric current where you see question marks in the following schematic diagram for a variable-speed AC motor drive, at the moment in time ($t_1$) specific on the oscillograph:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01715x01.eps}$$

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01715x02.eps}$$

Use conventional flow notation to show current direction (a ``positive'' current flowing from power source to motor, and a ``negative'' current flowing from motor to power source).  If there is no current going through a labeled wire or component, just write {\bf NO} instead of drawing an arrow on the diagram.

\vskip 10pt

Also, estimate the speed of the electric motor based on the waveforms shown in the oscillographs.
