%A variety of chemicals are added to raw water when treating it for human consumption, and also when treating water for many industrial processes.  In the {\it coagulation} stage, chemicals are added to cause suspended solids in the raw water to coalesce into larger particles called {\it floc}, which precipitate out of solution more readily.  To maximize effectiveness and to reduce waste, these chemicals need to be added to the water in specific proportions:

Mange kjemikalier brukes for å behandle vann, før det blir drikkevann. I koaguleringssteget blir kjemikalier tilsatt for å få suspendert stoff til å koagulere til større partikler kalt fnokker. Fnokker er sedimentere eller lettere kunne filtreres. Disse kjemikaliene må blandes i et bestemt forhold.

%If the raw water inlet flow and composition never change, the flocculant flow control setpoints may be left unchanged as well.  Once the correct proportions are set, the flocculant chemicals will continue to be added at just the right amounts.
Om innløpsvannet sin strømning eller sammensetning aldri forandrer seg. Kan settpunktet for tilsetting av kjemikalier v{\ae}re konstant. 

Men om strømningne på innløpsvannet varierer, må settpunktene varieres. Dette vil v{\ae}re tungvit og arbeidskrvende for operatøren, kan du komme opp med en løsning for forholdsregulering av dette systemet?

% But what if the raw water inlet flow {\it is} subject to change?  It would be quite inconvenient for operators to re-adjust the flocculant control setpoints every time a water flow rate change took place.  Can you think of a way to implement ratio control in this system to handle such changes automatically?

I'll let you sketch a possible solution to this problem!

Here is one possibility:

Polymer-based flocculants often have the undesirable effect of lowering the water's pH, which is not only bad for drinking purposes, but also bad because effective flocculation cannot occur if the pH is too low.  Lime powder is often added to the water in order to offset the low pH of the flocculant.  This lime flow may also be controlled by flow ratio, trimmed by a pH sensor and pH controller.
