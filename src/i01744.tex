%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Fast, self-regulating processes tend to respond well to aggressive integral action.  This is even true if the process in question has considerable noise (because integral ignores noise)!

\vskip 10pt

Processes having significant lag time do not respond well to aggressive integral action at all.
