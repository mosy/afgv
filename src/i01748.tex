Identify some factors {\it other} than poor controller tuning that can cause control loop instability, and how to rectify them.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here are a few:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Noise in the process variable signal
\item{} Stiction in the control valve
\item{} Slow control valve response
\item{} Transport time in the process
\item{} Wrong control valve characteristic (linear vs. quick-opening vs. equal percent)
\item{} Nonlinear process gain
\item{} Slow controller update time (compared to process reaction rate)
\end{itemize}

I'll let you determine how to fix these problems to improve control quality!
