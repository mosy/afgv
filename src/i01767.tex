Suppose the feedback bellows in this pneumatic controller were replaced with one significantly larger (having a much larger surface area for air pressure to act upon, and also a much larger internal volume):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01767x01.eps}$$

Identify the effects this component change would have on the controller, and on the process being controlled:

\vskip 10pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Will this alteration {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it not affect} the proportional band of the controller?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Will this alteration {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it not affect} the bias value in the controller's equation?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Will this alteration {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it not affect} the time it takes for the controller's output to fully respond to a sudden change in PV or SP signal?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Assuming the controller did a fine job controlling the process before this component change, describe how this alteration will affect the quality of control:
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} This alteration will {\bf increase} the proportional band of the controller.
\vskip 10pt
\item{} This alteration will {\bf decrease} the bias value in the controller's equation.
\vskip 10pt
\item{} This alteration will {\bf increase} the response time of the controller to a sudden change in PV or SP signal.
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Assuming the controller did a fine job controlling the process before this component change, this alteration will cause the control quality to be sluggish and also develop a larger PV $-$ SP offset than before.
\end{itemize}
