Suppose exactly 1000 calories of heat energy is transferred to a 5-gram mass of water at 20$^{o}$ C and at atmospheric pressure (sea level).  Calculate what will happen to the water (how far will its temperature be raised, and if it boils, how much steam will be liberated from the water?).

\vskip 10pt

Hint: the specific heat of water is 1 calorie/gram-C$^{o}$.  The latent heat of fusion for water is 80 calories/gram, and the latent heat of vaporization for water is 540 calories/gram.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

To raise the water's temperature from 20$^{o}$ C to 100$^{o}$ C will require this much heat energy:

$$Q = m c \Delta T$$

$Q$ = (5 g)(1 cal/g-C$^{o}$)(100$^{o}$ C $-$ 20$^{o}$ C)
 
\vskip 10pt

$Q$ = (5 g)(1 cal/g-C$^{o}$)(80$^{o}$ C) 
 
\vskip 10pt

$Q$ = 400 cal 
 
\vskip 10pt

This leaves 600 calories remaining from the original 1000 calorie heat dose to boil water into steam.  Since the latent heat of vaporization is 540 calories/gram, 600 calories will vaporize this many grams of water:
 
\vskip 10pt

$$L_v = {Q \over m}$$

$$m = {Q \over L_v}$$

$m$ = (600 cal)/(540 cal/g)

\vskip 10pt

$m$ = 1.111 g
 
\vskip 10pt
 
Thus, 1.111 grams of water will boil into steam, and then the 1000 calories of heat energy will be spent.
