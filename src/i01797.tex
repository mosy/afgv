Suppose a steam boiler is supposed to have a capacity of 300 pounds (of steam) per hour.  How much heat energy (in BTUs per hour) will it take to boil this rate of steam, assuming that water enters the boiler at 212 $^{o}$F?

\vskip 10pt

Hint: the specific heat of water is 1 BTU/lb$_{m}$-F$^{o}$.  The latent heat of fusion for water is 144 BTU/lb$_{m}$, and the latent heat of vaporization for water is 970 BTU/lb$_{m}$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Since the latent heat of vaporization for water is 970 BTU/lb$_{m}$, and we wish to boil 300 pounds of steam per hour, this equates to the following number of BTUs each and every hour:

$$Q = m L_v$$

$Q$ = (300 lb$_{m}$)(970 BTU/lb$_{m}$)

\vskip 10pt

$Q$ = 291,000 BTU

\vskip 10pt

Thus, the required heat input to the boiler (assuming 100\% efficiency) is 291,000 BTU/hour.  Since no boiler is perfectly efficient, though, the actual required heat input will be greater than this.
