Industrial operations using large quantities of steam often distribute it at different pressures, much like an electrical utility system distributing power at several different voltages:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01801x01.eps}$$

It may not always be practical to have a separate boiler (or set of boilers) for each header pressure (e.g. one boiler outputting 600 PSI, one outputting 150 PSI, and one outputting 30 PSI).  So, often there is a need to ``let down'' high-pressure steam to a lower pressure.

Although it is possible to simply use control valves to throttle high-pressure steam into a lower-pressure headers, this would be a waste of energy.  Such a strategy would be analogous to using resistive voltage dividers to step high voltage down to lower values in an electric power system:

An improvement over the plain let-down strategy is to use special {\it desuperheating} valves instead of normal throttling valves.  Desuperheating is a process whereby water is sprayed into the throttled steam:

Desuperheaters may be thought of as the steam equivalent of electrical transformers: a much more efficient means of reducing pressure (voltage) than throttling with a restrictive (resistive) element.  Explain how desuperheating works, and why the electrical transformer analogy is appropriate.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The water injected in a desuperheating valve gains heat energy from the superheated let-down steam, producing a greater volume of steam at a lower pressure (and lower temperature), much like an electrical transformer steps down voltage with a corresponding {\it increase} in current.  Desuperheaters exchange temperature for volume, much like transformers exchange voltage for current (or vice-versa).
