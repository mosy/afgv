%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I recommend deducting 0.5 point for each incorrectly-shaped segment of the output line in each graph.  This way, students can still get partial credit even if one or more of the initial segments is drawn incorrectly:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01850x02.eps}$$

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01850x03.eps}$$

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01850x04.eps}$$
