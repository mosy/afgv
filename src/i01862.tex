Suppose you are working on the job, and you are the first to encounter a person who has been seriously injured.  The person in question is clearly in need of help, and no one else is there besides you.

\vskip 10pt

What is the {\it very first thing} you should do in this event, before giving any direct aid to the injured person?  Note: the answer here is exactly the same for non-industrial emergencies!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Activate the emergency response system for the facility.  Sometimes this may take the form of a fire alarm pull box, or perhaps a radio (walkie-talkie) call for help.  Whatever emergency response system is in place at this facility, you need to summon help right away so that qualified people attend to the injured person, and also so you do not succumb to the same hazard in trying to help the injured person.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: think of a scenario where {\it not} activating the emergency response system as a first step could cause additional problems.
