The rate of heat energy lost ($P$) from a hot object due to radiation is given by the following formula, where $T$ is the temperature of the object, $A$ is its surface area, $e$ is the emissivity factor, and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant:
 
$$P = e \sigma A T^4$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $T$:
