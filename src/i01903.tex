Suppose you need to test a loop controller for proper operation on a workbench (not while it's connected to a real process), and you decide to measure its output signal using a {\it loop calibrator}:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01903x01.eps}$$

Sketch any necessary wire connections to send an analog signal from the loop controller to the loop calibrator, using the loop calibrator as the calibration standard (i.e. trusting the loop calibrator's accuracy).  Assume the controller has a proper AC power source already connected to it.  You must also specify the proper mode to set the loop calibrator to: {\it Source}, {\it Read} (measure), or {\it 2-wire} (simulate).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I recommend all-or-nothing scoring for this question, as the calibrator mode and wiring scheme must complement each other in order for the circuit to properly function:
