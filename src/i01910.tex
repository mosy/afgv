$$E_p = W = Fx   \hskip 50pt   E_p = mgh   \hskip 50pt   E_k = {1 \over 2} mv^2$$

\noindent
Where,

$E_p$ = Potential energy in joules (metric) or foot-pounds (British)

$W$ = Work in joules (metric) or foot-pounds (British)

$E_k$ = Kinetic energy in joules (metric) or foot-pounds (British)

$m$ = Mass of object in kilograms (metric) or slugs (British)

$g$ = Acceleration of gravity in meters per second squared (metric) or feet per second squared (British)

$h$ = Height of lift in meters (metric) or feet (British)

$v$ = Velocity in meters per second (metric) or feet per second (British)

$$F = kx   \hskip 50pt   E_p = {1 \over 2}kx^2 $$

\noindent
Where,

$E_p$ = Potential energy stored in a tensed spring in joules (metric), or foot-pounds or inch-pounds (British)

$k$ = Spring constant in newtons per meter (metric), or pounds per foot or pounds per inch (British)

$x$ = Displacement of spring in meters (metric), or feet or inches (British)

$$I = C {dV \over dt}$$

\noindent
Where,

$I$ = Current ``through'' a capacitor in amperes

$C$ = Capacitance of capacitor in farads
