Suppose an instrument technician tests a proportional-only pneumatic controller on a workbench by setting its setpoint to 50\% and applying a variety of air pressure signals to its input, while recording the air pressure it outputs.  This is a standard-range controller, with a 3-15 PSI process variable signal range and a 3-15 PSI output signal range:

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

From these recorded figures, determine:

\vskip 10pt

The controller's gain ($K_p$) = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}

\vskip 10pt

The controller's proportional band = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \%

\vskip 10pt

The controller's bias value = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \%

\vskip 10pt

The controller's action = {\it direct} or {\it reverse}


\underbar{file i01913}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Award 3 points each for the gain and PB values, 2 points each for the bias value and action:

\vskip 10pt

The controller's gain ($K_p$) = \underbar{\bf 1.2}

\vskip 10pt

The controller's proportional band = \underbar{\bf 83.33 \%}

\vskip 10pt

The controller's bias value = \underbar{\bf 88.5 \%}

\vskip 10pt

The controller's action = {\bf direct}
