Examine this process trend showing the PV, SP, and Output of a loop controller:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01925x01.eps}$$

Based on what you see here, determine the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Whether this is an open-loop or a closed-loop response
\item{} Whether the controller is (or needs to be) {\it direct-acting} or {\it reverse-acting}
\item{} If possible, identify any problems with the field instrumentation
\item{} If possible, identify any problems with the controller PID tuning
\item{} Qualitatively identify the kind of PID tuning we will need for robust control
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an {\it open-loop test}, based on the fact the output signal is square-wave stepping as it would when a human operator enters new values in manual mode.

\vskip 10pt

Since this is a manual-mode test, we know we are looking at the response of the {\it process}, not the {\it PID controller}.  Based on this test, we see the process has a direct response, which means the controller must be {\it reverse-acting} in order to have the negative feedback we need for stable control.

\vskip 10pt

The process exhibits a varying gain, increasing as the valve is opened further.  We cannot pinpoint the cause of this problem; it could be an incorrect control valve characteristic, a nonlinear transmitter, or perhaps some nonlinearity inherent to the process itself.

\vskip 10pt

We cannot tell if there are any tuning problems with the controller, because this trend does not show us the results in automatic mode (closed-loop).

\vskip 10pt

We can tell from the process response that this is a self-regulating process with a few seconds of first-order lag combined with a very short dead time.  Consequently, we would expect to need integral action to avoid offset between PV and SP, plus some proportional action.  The presence of some noise on the PV signal makes the application of derivative unlikely.
