On the first day of this course, we surveyed some of the many industries where measurement and automation are applied, as well as discussed the range and complexity of knowledge and skill areas critical for an instrument technician to master.  You were also left with a question to ponder: 

\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

{\it How is it possible for a program of instruction such as BTC's Instrumentation and Control Technology program to teach students these most difficult-to-learn knowledge and skill areas, and to do so in just two years?} 

\par} \vskip 10pt

After experiencing the structure and expectations of this course, how would you answer this question?

In 2009, the {\it Industrial Instrumentation and Control Technology Alliance} (IICTA) conducted a survey of 23 industrial instrumentation experts from across the United States to rank the relative importance of knowledge and skill areas listed on the {\it Texas Skill Standards Board} (TSSB) skill standard for ``Industrial Instrumentation and Controls Technician.''  The following is a list of knowledge/skill areas from this skill standard where ``critically important'' (the absolute highest importance) was the most popular vote of the experts surveyed, along with the percentage of experts voting the knowledge/skill area as ``critial'', and also a qualitative judgment of how difficult it is for someone to acquire the knowledge or skill if new:

On January 24, 2013 the Washington State Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board presented results of a survey gathering input from over 2800 employers state-wide.  One of the questions on this survey asked employers if they had experienced difficulty with entry-level employees demonstrating the following skills.  A partial listing of results is shown here:

In July and August of 2011, the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte Development LLC worked together to adminster a ``Skills Gap study'' across a range of manufacturing industries in the United States.  Survey results were collected from 1123 respondents, with one of the survey questions asking {\it ``What are the most serious skill deficiencies in your current employees?''}.  The responses to this question are tabulated here:

In December of 2001, the question ``What qualities should an Instrumentation graduate possess in order to excel in their profession?'' was posed to representatives on the Advisory Committee for BTC's Instrumentation program.  In addition to a firm knowledge of fundamentals (electronics, physics, mathematics, process control), one advisor in particular noted that ``self-direction and the ability to learn on your own'' was even more important.  Why do you suppose self-direction and self-teaching ability would be more highly valued than technical expertise in this career?

\noindent
Here are some strategies applied in the INST courses to achieve these daunting goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Place the student in a role of responsibility whenever possible:
\itemitem{} Responsible for first contact with new subjects
\itemitem{} Responsible for researching answers to questions
\itemitem{} Responsible for demonstrating knowledge and skill every day
\itemitem{} Responsible for meeting deadlines for completion of work
\itemitem{} Responsible for tracking assignments and grades
\item{} Demand mastery-level (100\%) competence on all essential objectives
\item{} Require independent and continuous learning on a daily basis
\item{} Emphasize reading as {\it the} single most important foundational skill for learning
\item{} Practice problem-solving every day 
\item{} Assess problem-solving ability in every exam
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\bf In summary, the way to ensure graduates are self-directed learners with strong problem-solving ability is to require these very traits for successful course completion!}
