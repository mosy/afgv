The volumetric flow rate ($Q$) sensed by an orifice-type flowmeter is given by the following formula, where $P_1$ is the upstream pressure, $P_2$ is the downstream pressure, $\rho$ is the liquid's density, and $k$ is a factor accounting for unit conversions and imperfections in the flowstream:
 
$$Q = k \sqrt{{P_1 - P_2} \over \rho}$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $P_1$:
