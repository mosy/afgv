The speed of light through any dielectric substance ($v$) is given by this formula, where $c$ is the speed of light in a perfect vacuum and $\epsilon$ is the relative permittivity of the dielectric medium:
 
$$v = {c \over \sqrt{\epsilon}}$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $\epsilon$:
