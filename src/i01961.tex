The resistance of an ``RTD'' temperature sensor ($R$) is given by this formula, where $T$ is the temperature of the RTD, $R_0$ is the RTD's resistance at the reference temperature ($T_{ref}$), and $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance:
 
$$R = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_{ref})]$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $\alpha$:
