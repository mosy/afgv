The {\it pressure recovery factor} ($F_L$) of a control valve is given by the following formula, where $P_1$ is the upstream pressure, $P_2$ is the downstream pressure, and $P_{vc}$ is the pressure at the vena contract point inside the valve:
 
$$F_L = \sqrt{P_1 - P_2 \over P_1 - P_{vc}}$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $P_2$:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$P_2 = P_1 - F_L^2(P_1 - P_{vc})$$
