The gain of an amplifier expressed in {\it decibels} ($A_{dB}$) is given by the following formula, where $P_{in}$ is the power input to the amplifier and $P_{out}$ is the power output from the amplifier:
 
$$A_{dB} = 10 \log {P_{out} \over P_{in}}$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $P_{in}$:
