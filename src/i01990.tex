These two control valves are split-ranged, driven by a common pneumatic output signal from one I/P transducer.  The bench set range for each valve is specified as necessary to create the split-range sequencing:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01990x01.eps}$$

Calculate each valve position (in percentage open: 0\% being fully shut and 100\% being fully open), assuming a current signal to the I/P of 9.8 mA:

\vskip 20pt

\hskip 50pt PV-33a = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \% open \hskip 60pt PV-33b = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \% open

\underbar{file i01990}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

PV-33a = \underbar{\bf 0} \% open \hskip 100pt PV-33b = \underbar{\bf 72.5} \% open
