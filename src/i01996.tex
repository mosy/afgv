Examine this process trend, showing the response of the process variable to a 10\% up-and-down step change in the controller output (placed in manual mode):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01996x01.eps}$$

Based on this open loop response, qualitatively predict the necessary P, I, and D actions of the controller, using terms such as ``none,'' ``weak,'' ``moderate,'' and ``aggressive.''

\vskip 10pt

Proportional = \underbar{\hskip 70pt} \hskip 20pt Integral = \underbar{\hskip 70pt} \hskip 20pt Derivative = \underbar{\hskip 70pt}

\vskip 10pt

Also determine whether the controller needs to be {\it direct-acting} or {\it reverse-acting}.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

3 points for P, 2 points each for I and D, 3 points for action.

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
Proportional = \underbar{{\bf Aggressive} or {\bf Moderate}} \hskip 10pt Integral = \underbar{{\bf None} or {\bf Weak}} \hskip 10pt Derivative = \underbar{{\bf None} or {\bf Weak}}

\vskip 10pt

The controller needs to be {\bf direct-acting}.
