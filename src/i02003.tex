Determine an adequate $C_v$ rating for this micro-hydro turbine speed control valve, given the following installation and flow parameters.  Ignore hydraulic friction along the length of the pipe:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02003x01.eps}$$

$C_v$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}

\vskip 10pt

Also, identify the type of valve body used in this system:

\underbar{file i02003}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$C_v$ = \underbar{\bf 59.43}

\vskip 10pt

Valve type: {\bf characterized ball valve}. (-2 points if no mention of ``characterized'' or ``segmented'')
