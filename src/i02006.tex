The following formula describes the rate of liquid flow ($Q$) through a magnetic flowmeter having a tube diameter $d$ and magnetic flux density $B$, generating an induced voltage $E$ across the diameter of the tube.  A ``k factor'' ($k$) having a value less than 1 accounts for imperfections in the device:

$$Q = k {\pi d E \over 4 B}$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $d$:
