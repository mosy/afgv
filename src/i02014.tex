The failure rate ($\lambda$) for a well-maintained batch of devices may be calculated using the following formula, based on the total number of devices ($N_o$) in the batch, number of failed devices ($N_f$) during the test period, and the duration of the test ($t$):

$$\lambda = {N_f \over t} {1 \over N_o}$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $t$:
