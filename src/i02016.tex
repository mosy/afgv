A direct-acting proportional-only loop controller executes the following formula to calculate the output value ($m$), where $K$ is the gain of the controller, $b$ is the bias value of the controller, $P$ is the process variable, and $S$ is the setpoint:

$$m = K(P - S) + b$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $P$:
