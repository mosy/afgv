The apparent weight ($W_A$) of an object submerged in a liquid is described by the following formula, where $W_D$ is the ``dry'' weight of the object, $V$ is the volume of liquid displaced by the object, and $\gamma$ is the weight density of the liquid:

$$W_A = W_D - \gamma V$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $\gamma$:
