This formula describes the amount of energy carried by a photon:

$$E = {hc \over \lambda}$$

\noindent
Where,

$E_k =$ Energy carried by photon (joules)

$h =$ Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ joule-seconds)

$c =$ Speed of light in a vacuum ($\approx 3 \times 10^8$ meters per second)

$\lambda$ = Wavelength of photon (meters)

\vskip 10pt

Manipulate this equation as many times as necessary to express it in terms of all its variables.
