Suppose you need to connect three pressure switches to channels IN-4, IN-6, and IN-13 of an Allen-Bradley model 1756-IA16 discrete input card:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02060x01.eps}$$

Sketch the necessary wire connections to make these three pressure switches functional on the specified input channels, including any necessary power source(s) in your sketched circuit.

Note: you may find Allen-Bradley's document called {\it ``1756 ControlLogix I/O Modules''} (publication 1756-TD002A-EN-E, May 2009) helpful in answering this question.
