Interpret the temperature measurement displayed by this gauge mechanism, and also identify the meaning of the {\it other} pointer:

$$\epsfxsize=6in \includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02063x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file i02063}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The current temperature is 40 degrees Celsius (red pointer), and the other pointer is a low-temperature capture.  In this case, the ``capture'' pointer shows that the temperature went down as low as 20 degrees Celsius (or perhaps a bit lower, since parallax error is making that pointer appear to read higher than it actually is).
