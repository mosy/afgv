The {\it Ideal Gas Law} formula describes the relationship between gas pressure ($P$), container volume ($V$), molecular quantity ($n$), and temperature ($T$) for an enclosed gas, with $R$ being the ``universal gas law constant'':

$$PV = nRT$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $R$:
