This level-control system is supposed to maintain a constant liquid level inside the knockout drum, preventing liquid from entering the compressor as well as gas from entering the scavenging pump.  Yet, for some reason liquid did manage to enter the compressor, causing the compressor to suffer major damage, and leading to a complete shut-down of the unit:

A trend recording of liquid level and control valve position captured before the explosion holds the only clue as to why this happened.  Examine it to see if you can determine the source of the trouble:

The trend holds all the clues for us here.  Here we see the level transmitter failed with a signal value ``frozen'' slightly below setpoint, causing the control valve position to integrate downward as indicated by the ramping output trend.  As the valve pinched down more and more, the knockout drum level accelerated upward, eventually letting liquid into the suction of the compressor.

A general diagnostic tip for process troubleshooting is to remember that ``noise'' is a normal thing to see in a process variable trend.  If a trend goes from (normally) noisy to flat-line, something has most likely gone wrong with the sensing of that variable.  In fact, some smart pressure transmitter manufacturers equip their pressure sensors with a ``plugged line'' diagnostic to detect the plugging of impulse lines between the sensor and the process vessel, based on the amount of pressure ``noise'' seen by the transmitter over time.  If the transmitter's self-diagnostic algorithms detect substantially less pressure noise than normal, it flags an alarm calling for maintenance personnel to check the impulse line(s) for plugging.
