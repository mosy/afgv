Here, a temperature sensor called an {\it RTD} is used to translate ambient temperature into a proportional resistance.  This in turn is converted into a proportional voltage signal by a constant current fed through the RTD by the current source:

Determine how to connect the first analog input channel this DAQ to measure the RTD's voltage drop, but in such a way that voltage dropped along the cable's length will not affect the measurement.  Also, determine whether this DAQ should be configured for {\it single-ended} or {\it differential} input
