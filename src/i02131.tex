Two instrument technicians are arguing over how to build a current transformer (CT) circuit to facilitate convenient measurement of CT secondary current without having to break the circuit open, because they both recognize the danger of an open-circuited CT.

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02131x01.eps}$$

Technician ``A'' proposes installing a {\it shunt resistor} (on the order of 1 milliohm resistance) in series with the CT secondary wiring, so that a technician may connect an AC millivoltmeter across the shunt and use the measured voltage to calculate current.  Technician ``B'' proposes installing a {\it diode} in series with the CT secondary wiring, so that a technician may connect an AC ammeter across the diode and measure current (just like in a 4-20 mA loop circuit).  

Do you think either of these proposals are valid?  Is one better than the other?  Explain your answer in detail.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Half-credit for identifying the better proposal, and half-credit for explaining why the other proposal would not work.

\vskip 10pt

Technician ``A'' has the best proposal.  A shunt resistor of low value would permit indirect measurement of current (by measuring AC millivoltage and calculating current using Ohm's Law).  

Technician ``B's'' idea will not work, and in fact is dangerous.  Since the current in question is AC and not DC, the diode will cause the CT to be open-circuited every half-cycle, which of course will cause high voltages to develop across the CT secondary winding every half-cycle with much damage and hazard to nearby personnel!
