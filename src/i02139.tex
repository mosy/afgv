This newly-commissioned level control system appears to have a problem.  The SP is set for 2.5 feet (out of a 0-5 foot range), but the PV display on the controller faceplate registers 3.73 feet, and has been doing so for hours.  The controller's output display shows an output of 48.6\%.  A field operator informs you that a sightglass on this vessel reads 3 feet 9 inches, and the control valve stem position is approximately 50\% open.

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this control system.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.
