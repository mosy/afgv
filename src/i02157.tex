The voltage signal output ($V_{out}$) by an operational amplifier is described by the following formula, where $V_1$ is the noninverting input signal, $V_2$ is the inverting signal, $A_{OL}$ is the open-loop gain, and $b$ is the input bias (offset) voltage:

$$V_{out} = A_{OL} (V_1 - V_2 + b)$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $A_{OL}$:
