Convert the following numbers from decimal (base-ten) to binary (base-two):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $7_{10}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{} $10_{10}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{} $19_{10}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{} $250_{10}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{} $511_{10}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{} $824_{10}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{} $1044_{10}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{} $9241_{10}$ =
\end{itemize}

Describe a general, step-by-step procedure for converting decimal numbers into binary numbers.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The most important part of this question, of course, is the {\it method} of translating decimal into binary.  Don't tell your students how to do this, as there are plenty of good references to be found on the procedure.  If a student cannot research and understand how to convert decimal into binary without your help, they aren't trying hard enough!
