Industrial signal cables are often comprised of {\it twisted, shielded wire pairs}.  Both the twisting of the wire pairs and the shielding encapsulating the pairs works to protect the signals from corruption due to external noise.  One of these techniques guards against interference from stray electrical fields while the other guards against interference from stray magnetic fields.  Identify which does which, and explain why.

Furthermore, explain how a multimeter set to measure AC voltage (ideally, AC millivolts) could be used to detect the presence of {\it electric} field-induced noise anywhere along the cable's length.  Also, explain how a multimeter set to measure AC millivoltage could be used to detect the presence of {\it magnetic} field-induced noise anywhere along the cable's length.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify what would cause a {\it ground loop} to form in this cable, why that would be a bad thing, and how we may avoid it.
\item{} Is the {\it rate of twist} of the wire pair relevant to noise immunity?  If so, which would be better -- a cable with a ``slow'' twist or a cable with a tightly-twisted wire pair?
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Shielding guards against electric fields by creating a zero-potential surface around the wires to act as a terminal point for any external electric fields.  Thus, the space inside the cable is free from external electric fields by virtue of the shield.

Twisting the wires ensures that a current loop will never be formed to allow electromagnetic induction from external (changing) magnetic fields.  The following ``thought experiment'' comparing two scenarios proves this conclusively:

{\bf Prep Quiz:}

The {\it twisting} of conductors and the presence of a {\it shield} in an instrument cable guards against two kinds of interference.  Identify which type of interference is guarded by which feature of the cable:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Twisting for ground faults; shield for magnetic fields
