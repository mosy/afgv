The driver (output) circuits inside of EIA/TIA-485 transceivers must be equipped with {\it tri-state} outputs.  Explain what a ``tri-state'' output is, and why it is essential for multipoint transceivers to have:

Also, would you classify the above network as a {\it simplex}, {\it half-duplex}, or {\it full-duplex} system?  Explain why.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Can you identify the channel arbitration strategy (e.g master-slave, token passing, TDMA) of this digital network from its schematic diagram? If so, which strategy do you think it uses?
\item{} Does this digital network require termination resistors?  If so, where should they be placed?
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A tri-state digital device has three output modes: {\it high}, {\it low}, and {\it high-Z}, the latter state being where the output transistors all go into cutoff and ``disconnect'' themselves so they neither source nor sink current.

Does this symbol jog some memories of your previous electronics studies?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a half-duplex system, where tri-state buffers are necessary so that no receiving devices attempt to force a state on the lines.  All receiving devices must switch their drivers to ``high-impedance'' mode and let the one transmitting device define the line's mark and space states.

A common conceptual barrier among electronics students seems to be understanding why it is bad to have multiple logic gate outputs connected together (paralleled).  This is a good opportunity to review this important, yet easily misunderstood, topic.

Of course, simplex communication is possible here too, if only one driver is ever allowed to transmit!

{\bf Summary Quiz:}

{\it Tri-state driver} circuits are essential for digital devices to work within any {\it multipoint} network.  Identify the consequence of digital devices {\it not} having tri-state circuits in a multipoint network:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Only one device could communicate at a time
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Power consumption would be excessive
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} High-speed communication would be impossible
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Multiple device output states would conflict
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} An electrical shock hazard may result 
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} The devices might burst into flames!
