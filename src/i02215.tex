Determine the proper mode to place a loop calibrator in ({\it measure}, {\it source}, or {\it simulate}) to ``stroke'' a control valve that is located on a test bench in a shop, and also calculate the amount of current needed to position the control valve at 18\% open, assuming a 4-20 mA range and a control valve that is air-to-close (with a regular direct-acting I/P transducer supplying air to the valve).

\vskip 10pt

Proper loop calibrator mode = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}

\vskip 10pt

Current = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} mA

\underbar{file i02215}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Proper loop calibrator mode = \underbar{\bf Source}

Current = \underbar{\bf 17.12} mA
