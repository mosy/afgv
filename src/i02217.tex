Set up peer-to-peer EIA/TIA-485 networking between two personal computers, using a 232-to-485 converter plugged into the serial ports on the computers.  Follow the instructions included with the converters for wiring between them.  You will need a cable with two sets of twisted-pair wires, plus a shield (ideally).  Each computer will need to run a {\it terminal emulator} program such as {\tt hyperterminal} or {\tt kermit} in order to generate and read ASCII information.

After setting up both terminal emulators for the same parameters (stop and data bits, parity, baud rate, etc.) and connecting the null modem cable, you should be able to type messages in one computer and read those messages on the other!

Try experimenting with different baud rates to see how fast you can send messages without errors!

No answers provided here.  You'll have to try it yourself on a real computer!
