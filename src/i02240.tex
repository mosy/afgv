Sketch the necessary wire connections such that the 120 volt lamp will turn {\it on} when the pushbutton switch is pressed and turn {\it off} when the pushbutton switch is released.  Ensure that the switch contacts only experience 24 volts, while the relay switches 120 volts to the lamp:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02240x02.eps}$$

One could also use the NC switch contact and the NC relay contact, instead of using the NO contacts of each, to achieve the same result.
