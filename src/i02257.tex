Suppose we have an Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1000 PLC connected to two liquid level switches installed in the same tank, controlling a solenoid valve to empty liquid out of that tank:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02257x01.eps}$$

We wish for the solenoid valve to energize and open when the liquid level in the tank reaches 4.5 feet, then de-energize and shut when the liquid level falls to 3 feet.  Write a RLL program for the PLC (complete with correct address labels for each of the virtual contacts) to fulfill this function:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

When we read the requirements of this system -- to energize the solenoid at the high-level point and de-energize it at the low-level point, we know we need {\it hysteretic} behavior: what we need is for the solenoid to be turned on and off with a 1.5 foot ``deadband'' action.  Only a latching PLC program will be able to accomplish this feat.

The program we need this PLC to execute is not unlike a motor start/stop control, where one input causes the motor to start and the other causes it to stop, with the PLC ``latching'' the motor's state in between switching events.  Thus, we may develop a solution using retentive coil instructions, or by using the more traditional ``seal-in'' feedback algorithm whereby a standard coil instruction controls the motor's state, and a contact instruction addressed to that same bit keeps the motor in its last state.
