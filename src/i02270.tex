\item{} Identify which fundamental principles of electric circuits apply to each step of your analysis of this circuit.  In other words, be prepared to explain the reason(s) ``why'' for every step of your analysis, rather than merely describing those steps.
\item{} Suppose the center of the wye-connected load were connected to earth ground.  Determine the amount of voltage between each vertex of the delta-connected source and earth ground.
\item{} Suppose one of the vertices of the delta-connected source were connected to earth ground.  Determine the amount of voltage between each terminal of the wye-connected load and earth ground.
\item{} Suppose one of the vertices of the delta-connected source were connected to earth ground.  Determine the amount of voltage between the center point of the wye-connected load and earth ground.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $E_{line} =$ 2400 V
\item{} $I_{line} =$ 4.619 A
\item{} $E_{phase(source)} =$ 2400 V
\item{} $I_{phase(source)} =$ 4.619 A / $\sqrt{3}$ = 2.667 A
\item{} $E_{phase(load)} =$ 2400 V / $\sqrt{3}$ = 1385.6 V
\item{} $I_{phase(load)} =$ 1385.6 V / 300 $\Omega$ = 4.619 A
\item{} $P_{total} =$ ($\sqrt{3}$) (2400 V) (4.619 A) = 19.2 kW
