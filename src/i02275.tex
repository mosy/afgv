A motor controlled by a PLC refuses to start when the ``Start'' pushbutton switch is pressed.  A fellow instrument technician reports seeing the LED indicator for channel X1 on the input card unlit (not illuminated) while the operator was pressing the ``Start'' pushbutton, but does not report on the illumination status of any other LEDs on the PLC nor does he notice what happens when the operator releases the pushbutton.  Shown here is a partial wiring diagram and offline PLC program display for the system:

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault in this system.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} observations and symptoms in this circuit.
