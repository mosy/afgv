A standardized piece of hardware common to low-voltage electrical panels is something called {\it DIN rail}.  research what ``DIN rail'' is, and why it is so useful as a panel-building accessory material.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

DIN rail is a standardized shape and width of metal channel, upon which a wide variety of connectors and devices may be attached.  Modular terminal blocks are perhaps the best-known example of pieces designed to snap on to Din rail, but a great many other things are built to attach to this standard rail form.  Small power supplies, Ethernet hubs, relay sockets, and even entire programmable logic controllers (PLCs) have been built with dovetail snaps on the back sides designed to hold to DIN rail.  This rail allows modular components to be installed and removed with no further drilling of holes or adding of fasteners.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is common to place sections of wire duct to either side of a DIN rail length, so accommodate wiring to and from these rail-mounted devices.
