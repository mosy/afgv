A set of line reactors need to be sized for the input of a VFD.  We want each of these line reactors to present no more than 5 ohms of reactance to the 60 Hz fundamental power frequency, but at least 12 ohms of reactance to any higher-order (odd-numbered only) harmonic frequencies.  Calculate an upper and lower range of inductance values for these line reactors to satisfy the reactance requirements:

\vskip 30pt

$L$ (minimum) = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} mH

\vskip 30pt

$L$ (maximum) = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} mH

\underbar{file i02284}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$L$ (minimum) = \underbar{\bf 10.61} mH

$L$ (maximum) = \underbar{\bf 13.26} mH
