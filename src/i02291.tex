Suppose a voltmeter registers 0 volts between test points {\bf E} and {\bf F} in this circuit:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02291x01.eps}$$

Determine the diagnostic value of each of the following tests.  Assume only one fault in the system, including any single component or any single wire/cable/tube connecting components together.  If a proposed test could provide new information to help you identify the location and/or nature of the one fault, mark ``yes.''  Otherwise, if a proposed test would not reveal anything relevant to identifying the fault (already discernible from the measurements and symptoms given so far), mark ``no.''
