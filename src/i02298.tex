Three-phase electric motors are often equipped with a set of electrical terminals for configuring different voltage ranges and/or base speeds.  Different configurations consist of different patterns of ``jumper'' wires connecting these terminals together.  For example, here is an illustration of a three-phase electric motor with nine stud-and-nut terminals for connecting a set of six wire windings (coils) in two different configurations: one for low voltage (240 volts AC) and one for high voltage (480 volts AC):

When connecting the terminals for high-voltage operation, the goal is to have a ``delta'' configuration with two series-connected windings in each side of the triangle.  When connecting the terminals for low-voltage operation, the goal is to have two parallel ``delta'' winding sets.

This is just an exercise in connecting the dots!  A helpful problem-solving technique to apply to such problems is {\it tracing all connections made} in the schematic diagram after making those connections in the pictorial diagram.  This helps you keep track of which connections have been made, and which connections still need to be made.
