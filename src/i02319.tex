Predict how the operation of this relay logic circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no coincidental faults):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02319x01.eps}$$

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Pushbutton switch A fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Relay coil CR2 fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Relay contact CR1-1 fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Relay contact CR2-1 fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Relay contact CR2-2 fails shorted:
\end{itemize}

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify how ladder-logic type diagrams differ from standard electronic schematics, particularly with regard to how electromechanical relay coils and contacts are shown in each.
\item{} For each of the specified faults, identify how it could be diagnosed using a multimeter.
\item{} Identify how a technician could force Lamp 1 to energize regardless of switch status.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Pushbutton switch A fails open: {\it Lamp 1 always energized, lamp 2 simply becomes inverse status of pushbutton switch B.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Relay coil CR2 fails open: {\it Both lamp 1 and lamp 2 simply become inverse status of pushbutton switch A.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Relay contact CR1-1 fails open: {\it Lamp 1 simply becomes same status as pushbutton switch B.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Relay contact CR2-1 fails shorted: {\it Lamp 1 always energized.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Relay contact CR2-2 fails shorted: {\it Lamp 2 simply becomes inverse status of pushbutton switch A.}
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Virtual Troubleshooting} \vrule} \hrule}

This question is a good candidate for a ``Virtual Troubleshooting'' exercise.  Presenting the diagram to students, you first imagine in your own mind a particular fault in the system.  Then, you present one or more symptoms of that fault (something noticeable by an operator or other user of the system).  Students then propose various diagnostic tests to perform on this system to identify the nature and location of the fault, as though they were technicians trying to troubleshoot the problem.  Your job is to tell them what the result(s) would be for each of the proposed diagnostic tests, documenting those results where all the students can see.

During and after the exercise, it is good to ask students follow-up questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What does the result of the last diagnostic test tell you about the fault?
\item{} Suppose the results of the last diagnostic test were different.  What then would that result tell you about the fault?
\item{} Is the last diagnostic test the best one we could do?
\item{} What would be the ideal order of tests, to diagnose the problem in as few steps as possible?
\end{itemize}
