Here is an oscilloscope's view of an seven-bit data stream sent asynchronously with no parity bit, using {\it NRZ} (Non-Return to Zero) encoding:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02366x01.eps}$$

Identify the binary data represented by this waveform.

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02366x02.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The trick to decoding data here is knowing there are {\it seven} data bits, and figuring out how wide each one is.
