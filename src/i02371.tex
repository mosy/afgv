Suppose the high-pressure switch (PSH) in this compressor control system fails shorted (i.e. its contacts can never electrically open):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02371x01.eps}$$

Explain how this system will act when left in the ``Auto'' mode, given the following pressure switch settings calibrated when the system was first placed into service years ago:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Cut-out switch = {\it opens at 110 PSI rising, closes at 105 PSI falling}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} PSH = {\it opens at 95 PSI rising, closes at 93 PSI falling}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} PSL = {\it opens at 74 PSI rising, closes at 70 PSI falling}
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The receiver tank pressure will cycle between 70 PSI and 110 PSI, with the cut-out switch effectively acting as the new high-pressure control switch.
