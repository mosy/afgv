A line reactor connected to the input of a VFD is found to series-resonate with a 47 $\mu$F capacitor in the same AC power system at the third harmonic (180 Hz).  Calculate the inductance of this line reactor as it exists right now, and then choose a different inductance value that will avoid resonating at the first, third, or the fifth harmonic frequencies in this 60 Hz power system.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$L$ (existing) = \underbar{\bf 16.63} mH

$L$ (new) = any value that is {\it not} {\bf 149.7} mH, {\bf 16.63} mH, or {\bf 5.988} mH.
