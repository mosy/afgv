Determine proper resistor values for this EIA/TIA-485 communications network, given a two-wire cable with a surge impedance of 78 $\Omega$.  Assume that the cable is short and the connection noise-free, so that the bare-minimum idle state voltage ($-200$ mV) is sufficient to establish a ``mark'' state for the network.

Assume a DC power supply voltage of +24 volts, and a power dissipation of $1 \over 4$ watt (maximum) for each of the bias resistors.

\vskip 10pt

$R_{bias}$ (each) = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} $\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$R_{termination}$ (each) = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} $\Omega$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_{bias}$ (each) = \underbar{\bf 4.641 } k$\Omega$ (maximum)

$R_{bias}$ (each) = \underbar{\bf 494.93 } $\Omega$ (minimum) -- note: this is a difficult value to solve for, requiring use of the quadratic formula to solve ${-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} \over 2a$

\vskip 10pt

$R_{termination}$ (each) = \underbar{\bf 78} $\Omega$
