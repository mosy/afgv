Electrical {\it conduit} is important for safe and durable electrical wiring in outside environments.  Conduit is manufactured in both plastic (PVC) and metal (steel, aluminum) forms.  Determine which type of conduit is preferable for each of the following priorities:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Ease of assembly
\item{} Resistance to corrosive gases/liquids
\item{} Minimal material cost (assuming other factors do not take precedence)
\item{} Best shielding from electromagnetic interference
\item{} Maximum physical strength
\item{} Tightest sealing against vapor/liquid intrusion
\end{itemize}

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Considering the type of conduit providing the better electrical shielding, is it better with regard to electric field shielding, to magnetic field shielding, or to both?  Explain why.
\end{itemize}
