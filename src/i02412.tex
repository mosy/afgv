Explain how you would positively identify the {\it hot}, {\it neutral}, and {\it ground} conductors on a three-prong power receptacle.  A voltmeter is the only tool you are allowed to use:

This is a graded question -- no answers or hints given!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The ground pin is the one ``odd'' pin on the receptacle (non-flat).  A voltmeter will register AC voltage between the ``hot'' pin and ground, and no (or very little) voltage between the ``neutral'' and ground.
