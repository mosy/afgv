%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The answer given may be operational, or design-related.

\vskip 10pt

Operational definition: A synchronous motor spins in lock-step with the rotating magnetic field created by the stator, whereas an induction motor spins slightly slower (it has a ``slip'' speed).

\vskip 10pt

Design definition: A synchronous motor has a magnetized rotor, while an induction motor has an unmagnetized rotor.
