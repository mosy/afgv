Calculate all voltages, currents, and total power in this balanced three-phase system where a Wye-connected source provides electrical power to a 30 horsepower Delta-connected motor.  Assume the motor operates at full load (100\% power) with perfect power factor and perfect efficiency:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify which fundamental principles of electric circuits apply to each step of your analysis of this circuit.  In other words, be prepared to explain the reason(s) ``why'' for every step of your analysis, rather than merely describing those steps.
\item{} How might the results differ if the motor were not 100\% efficient?
\item{} How might the results differ if the power factor were less than 1?
\end{itemize}

Be sure to ask your students to describe {\it how} they arrived at the answers to this question.  There is more than one place to start in determining the solution here, and more than one way to calculate some of the figures.  No matter how your students may have approached this question, though, they should all obtain the same answers.
