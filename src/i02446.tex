This PLC is supposed to control the position of a motor-actuated valve using a 4-20 mA analog signal.  However, there seems to be a problem: the valve remains in the fully-closed position even when it is supposed to open.  A voltmeter connected between terminals I OUT 0 and ANL COM on the PLC's output card registers 24 VDC, while the same meter connected between terminals 7 and 6 registers 0 VDC:

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.
