A serial communication system is designed to transmit digital data in 7-bit blocks, with one parity bit added to make an 8-bit-long data ``frame.''  Take the following 7-bit data blocks and add the necessary parity bits to the most-significant position (MSB), assuming {\it odd parity}.  Be sure to write these 8-bit answers in {\it hexadecimal} form.
