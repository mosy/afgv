Identify the likeliest Class/Division ratings of the following classified areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Inside a grain silo, fed from the top by a conveyor belt
\vskip 5pt
\item{} At the vent pipe of a gasoline storage tank
\vskip 5pt
\item{} In a vehicle parking area on the edge of an oil refinery unit
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Storage room of a textile mill, where cotton fibers are held
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Interior of a cyclone separator at a sawmill
\end{itemize}

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} For any classified area application, which is generally easier to change by re-designing the process: the class rating or the division rating?
\item{} Suppose a portion of a manufacturing process is rated as Class I, Division 1.  What mitigating steps, if any, are able to down-grade it to a different Class or Division?  In other words, what could you add to, take away from, or otherwise alter in the process to change its Class/Division ratings to safer levels?
\item{} Suppose an industrial area contains both dust and fibers.  Which Class number do you think it should be rated, and why?
\item{} Identify any classified areas you can think of on campus, and rate them according to the Class/Division system.
\item{} Identify any classified areas you can think of on campus, and rate them according to the Zone system.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Partial answer:}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Inside a grain silo, fed from the top by a conveyor belt: {\it Class II, Division 1}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Storage room of a textile mill, where cotton fibers are held: {\it Class III, Division 2}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Interior of a cyclone separator at a sawmill: {\it Class III, Division 1} or {\it Class II, Division 1 if there is enough dust present in addition to chips and fibers}
\end{itemize}

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Inside a grain silo, fed from the top by a conveyor belt: {\it Class II, Division 1} -- hazard is a dust, present under normal conditions
\vskip 5pt
\item{} At the vent pipe of a gasoline storage tank: {\it Class I, Division 1} -- hazard is a vapor, present under normal conditions
\vskip 5pt
\item{} In a vehicle parking area near an oil refinery unit: {\it Class I, Division 2} -- hazard is a vapor, not present under normal conditions
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Storage room of a textile mill, where cotton fibers are held: {\it Class III, Division 2} -- hazard is a fiber, not present under normal conditions (i.e. cotton bolts not usually being disturbed while in storage)
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Interior of a cyclone separator at a sawmill: {\it Class III, Division 1} -- hazard is a fiber, present under normal conditions.  Due to the possibility that significant dust will be present as well, the proper classification may be {\it Class II, Division 1} in honor of the more significant hazard.
\end{itemize}
