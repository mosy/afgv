Two important concepts in control system engineering are {\it dependability} and {\it security}.  Dependability refers to the probability that a safety system will shut down a potentially dangerous process when needed, while security refers to the probability of that same system allowing the process to operate when there is no dangerous condition.  

For example, an emergency-stop shutdown system for a conveyor belt uses multiple emergency-stop switches which anyone can activate at multiple locations.  This provides a means of stopping a running conveyor belt in more than one place:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02488x01.eps}$$

Determine the {\it dependability} of this safety shutdown system in terms of how many ``Stop'' switches would have to be actuated to halt the conveyor.  Conversely, determine the {\it security} of this system in terms of how many ``Stop'' switches must be returned to their proper (running) positions in order to start the conveyor up.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Any one of the four ``Stop'' switches is capable of shutting the conveyor off ({\bf 1oo4} dependability).

\vskip 10pt

All four ``Stop'' switches must be returned to their normal positions in order to start the conveyor ({\bf 4oo4} security).
