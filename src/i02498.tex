A team of instrument technicians is salvaging differential pressure transmitters from an abandoned process unit at an old facility.  Upon removal, each transmitter is tested for proper operation.  At the end of this salvage operation, 53 transmitters were found to be good and 8 were found to be defective.

Unfortunately, all 61 transmitters were placed in the same crate, with no markings to designate which were good and which were defective.  Suppose you were to randomly grab a transmitter from this crate: what is the probability that the transmitter will be good?  Now, supposing the first transmitter you found was good; what is the probability that the {\it next} one you grab will be good?

Finally, calculate the probability that the {\it first two} transmitters you grab from this bin will both be good.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$P(\hbox{1st good})$ = 0.86885

\vskip 10pt

$P(\hbox{2nd good} | \hbox{1st good})$ = 0.86667

\vskip 10pt

$P(\hbox{1st {\it and} 2nd good})$ = 0.75301

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$P(\hbox{1st good})$ = $53 \over 61$ = 0.86885

\vskip 10pt

$P(\hbox{2nd good} | \hbox{1st good})$ = $52 \over 60$ = 0.86667

\vskip 10pt

$P(\hbox{1st {\it and} 2nd good})$ = ${\left( 53 \over 61 \right)}{\left( 52 \over 60 \right)}$ =  0.75301
