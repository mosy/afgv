You should be well aware of the need to separate power and signal wires in control cabinets and other electrical enclosures.  Failure to do so may result in power-line ``noise'' coupled to the signal circuitry, causing spurious signals.

\vskip 10pt

However, this hazard varies according to the types of signals placed near power conductors, and the type of power placed near signal conductors.  Rank the following signal types in order from most susceptible to noise (1) to most tolerant of noise (4):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} 4-20 milliamp DC, loop resistance = 250 $\Omega$
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} 24 VDC switch circuit to PLC input
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} 1-5 volt DC signal to loop indicator instrument
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} 4-20 milliamp DC, loop resistance = 100 $\Omega$
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Next, rank the following power types in order of most able to couple noise on to signal wires (1) to least able to corrupt signals (5):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} 60 Hz, 120 VAC, powering an incandescent lamp
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} Output of variable-frequency drive to motor (approx. 480 volts)
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} 250 VDC, powering an incandescent lamp
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} 60 Hz, 120 VAC, powering a personal computer with a switching power supply.
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} \underbar{\hskip 20pt} 60 Hz, 480 VAC, input to power a variable-frequency drive
\end{itemize}
