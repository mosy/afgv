%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{\bf AB}$ = 9.198 volts, {\bf A} positive and {\bf B} negative.

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02527x02.eps}$$

The voltage between points A and B is the supply voltage (26 volts) minus the voltage drops across the 1k and parallel subnetwork resistors.  Alternatively, one could calculate $V_{AB}$ by adding the voltage drops of the 1k and 270 ohm resistors.

The latter solution makes it easiest to see the polarity of $V_{AB}$: noting how the voltage drops across the 1k and 270 ohm resistors are additive, we see point A being the most positive and point B being the most negative.
