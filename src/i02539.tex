This elevator control system has a problem.  No matter which pushbutton is pressed, the elevator remains ``stuck'' in the full-down position.  The following pictorial diagram shows the wiring of this system, along with the I/O card status lights as they appear with no one pressing any pushbuttons:

Based on this information, determine a likely fault causing this elevator to remain stuck at the full-down position.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The PLC is not seeing the signal it needs to from the NC ``Stop'' pushbutton, and so it ``thinks'' someone is pressing the Stop pushbutton.  Possible faults include:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Stop pushbutton switch failed open
\item{} Open wire fault from Stop pushbutton to IN5 terminal
\item{} Open wire fault from terminal 3 to Stop pushbutton
\item{} Open wire fault from terminal 4 to fuse F1
\item{} Fuse F1 blown
\end{itemize}
