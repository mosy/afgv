Sketch the necessary wire connections to create a three-phase transformer bank fulfilling the phasor diagrams shown to the left of the transformers:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02564x01.eps}$$

Also, write the phase sequences (phase rotations) for both 3-phase busses, and identify whether the lower bus {\it leads}, {\it lags}, or is {\it in-phase} with the upper bus.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is not the only solution, but it will work.  Note the dots and numbers placed on the phasor diagrams to keep track of which transformers and which polarities are used:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02564x02.eps}$$

The upper bus phase rotation is ABC.

\vskip 10pt

The lower bus phase rotation is XZY.

\vskip 10pt

The phase shift between the two busses (comparing $V_A$ with $V_X$) is 60$^{o}$, with the lower bus {\it leading} the upper bus: $V_A = \angle 90^o$ and $V_X = \angle 150^o$
