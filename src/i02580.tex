Suppose a chemist asks you to provide her with a beaker containing 2.6 moles of pure sulfuric acid (H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$).  You have no way to directly measure ``moles'' of acid when you go to retrieve the acid from a storage tank and pour it into the beaker, so how do you fulfill the chemist's request?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

You might not be able to directly measure moles of acid, but you can certainly obtain a mass balance or scale to measure {\it grams} of acid!

\vskip 10pt

Sulfuric acid -- H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ -- has a molecular weight (approximately) equal to:

$$(2)(1) + (32)(1) + (16)(4) = 98 \hbox{ amu}$$

This means 1 mole of pure sulfuric acid will have a mass of 98 grams.  We may use this equivalence to set up a ``unity fraction'' and treat this as a units-conversion problem:

$$\left( {2.6 \hbox{ mol acid} \over 1} \right) \left( {98 \hbox{ g} \over 1 \hbox{ mol acid}} \right) = 254.8 \hbox{ g}$$

So, you just fill up the beaker with 254.8 grams of pure sulfuric acid, and you will have filled it with 2.6 moles of acid!
