A pressure ``cylinder'' containing hydrogen gas at a pressure of 2000 PSIG (137 atmospheres) was filled by a technician at Acme Hydrogen, Inc.  Unfortunately, the technician doesn't remember if he filled it with regular hydrogen gas ($^{1}$H$_{2}$) or with ``heavy'' hydrogen gas (deuterium, $^{2}$H$_{2}$).  Assuming the cylinder has an empty weight of 37.1 pounds, and now weighs 38.36 pounds, determine the type of hydrogen gas it's filled with. 

\vskip 10pt

The cylinder has an interior volume of 25 liters and is at ambient temperature of 20 $^{o}$C.

Hint: the Ideal Gas Law relates pressure, volume, molecular quantity, and temperature for most gases:

$$PV = nRT$$

\noindent
Where,

$P$ = Absolute pressure (atmospheres)

$V$ = Volume (liters)

$n$ = Gas quantity (moles)

$R$ = Universal gas constant (0.0821 L $\cdot$ atm / mol $\cdot$ K)

$T$ = Absolute temperature (K) = degrees Celcius ($^{o}$C) + 273.15

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

One problem-solving strategy would be to calculate the number of moles ($n$) of gas filling this cylinder at the stated conditions of 2000 PSIG, 25 liters, and 20 $^{o}$C.  2000 PSIG is equivalent to 137 atmospheres of absolute pressure.  20 $^{o}$C is equivalent to 293.15 Kelvin absolute temperature.  Solving for $n$:

$$PV = nRT$$

$$n = {PV \over RT} = {(137)(25) \over (0.0821)(293.15)} = 142.3 \hbox{ moles of gas}$$

The weight of the gas is simply the current weight of the cylinder minus the cylinder's empty weight:

$$38.36 - 37.1 = 1.26 \hbox{ lb} = 0.5715 \hbox{ kg} = 571.5 \hbox{ grams}$$

Taking the ratio of grams to moles tells us the molecular weight of the gas filling the cylinder:

$${571.5 \hbox{ g} \over 142.3 \hbox{ mol}} = 4.02 \hbox{ amu}$$

The gas in question must be deuterium (``heavy'' hydrogen, $^{2}$H$_{2}$), with each molecule having an atomic mass of 4.
