Analyze the status of all relay contacts and lamps in this hard-wired relay ``ladder logic'' control circuit:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02605x01.eps}$$

Assume the following input conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Pushbutton switch {\it unpressed}
\item{} Pressure {\it above} trip threshold
\item{} Selector switch in its {\it right-hand} position
\end{itemize}

\vfil \eject

Now, analyze the status of this PLC-controlled system assuming the same input conditions.  Note the distinction between the 120 VAC circuitry and the ``virtual circuit'' in the blue-shaded area representing the program executed by the PLC's microprocessor:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02605x02.eps}$$

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Pushbutton switch {\it unpressed}
\item{} Pressure {\it above} trip threshold
\item{} Selector switch in its {\it right-hand} position
\end{itemize}

How is the PLC-controlled system similar to the hard-wired relay control system?  How is it different?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A good problem-solving technique to apply in both diagrams is {\it annotation}, where you indicate the presence of continuity and power versus non-continuity/unpowered.  In PLC programs this usually appears in the form of color-highlighting surrounding each instruction symbol (virtual contact or virtual coil).
