A laborer working on the top of a building uses a manual hoist to lift 20 gallons of water 31 feet up from ground level.  The time required for the laborer to do this job is one minute:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02611x01.eps}$$

Several hours later, a different laborer does the exact same job of hoisting 20 gallons of water to the roof, but does so in only 40 seconds.

\vskip 10pt

Which laborer performs more work in lifting 20 gallons of water to the roof?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a trick question: both laborers do the exact same amount of work.  The second laborer, however, does the same work with {\it greater power} than the first laborer, since the second laborer's work was done in a shorter amount of time.
