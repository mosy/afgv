%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The first lever (where force {\bf F} works on the right-hand end) is a first-class, with a mechanical advantage of 4:3.  It connects to a second lever (third-class), with an mechanical advantage ratio (actually, a {\it disadvantage} ratio) of 5:8.  The overall mechanical advantage is the product of these two advantage ratios:

$$M_A = \left( 4 \over 3 \right) \left(5 \over 8 \right) = {5 \over 6} = 0.83333$$

In other words, for every pound of force applied at {\bf F}, there will be 0.8333 pounds of force available to move the mass.
