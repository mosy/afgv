An automobile weighing 2700 pounds is traveling over level ground at a velocity of 50 miles per hour.  If the driver places the vehicle's transmission in neutral (so the engine is disconnected from the wheels) and applies force to the brake pedal, the vehicle will slow down.

\vskip 10pt

Assuming the braking force on the automobile is a constant 500 pounds (friction opposed to the direction of the automobile's motion), how many feet will the vehicle travel before coming to a rest?  Ignore any air friction, and assume that the braking force is the only decelerating force in this mechanical system.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Because we are going to have to calculate kinetic energy, we know that sooner or later we will need to know the automobile's mass in units of slugs and the velocity in units of feet per second, so let's get these calculations over with now:

$$F = m a$$

$$m = {F \over a}$$

$$m = {2700 \hbox{ lb} \over 32.3 \hbox{ ft/s}^2} = 83.85 \hbox{ slugs}$$

\vskip 10pt

$$\left(50 \hbox{ mi} \over \hbox{h} \right) \left(1 \hbox{ h} \over 3600 \hbox{ s} \right) \left(5280 \hbox{ ft} \over 1 \hbox{ mi} \right) = 73.333 \hbox{ ft/s}$$

\vskip 10pt

Now we are all set to calculate the automobile's initial kinetic energy:

$$E_k = {1 \over 2} m v^2$$

$$E_k = {1 \over 2} (83.85 \hbox{ slugs}) (73.33 \hbox{ ft/s})^2$$

$$E_k = 225,465.84 \hbox{ ft-lb of kinetic energy at 50 MPH}$$

The automobile's brakes convert this kinetic into heat, through friction.  In order to being the velocity to zero, the work done on the automobile by the brakes' friction must cancel out the initial kinetic energy at 50 MPH.  Note that we will use 180$^{o}$ as the angle $\theta$ in the work calculation, because the brakes' force vector opposes the direction of the car's displacement:

$$0 = W + E_k$$

$$0 = F x \cos \theta + E_k$$

$$0 = (500 \hbox{ lb}) x \cos 180^o + 225,465.84 \hbox{ ft-lb}$$

$$-225,465.84 \hbox{ ft-lb} = (500 \hbox{ lb}) x \cos 180^o$$

$$x = {-225,465.84 \hbox{ ft-lb} \over (500 \hbox{ lb}) (\cos 180^o)}$$

$$x = {-225,465.84 \hbox{ ft-lb} \over -500 \hbox{ lb}}$$

$$x = 450.93 \hbox{ ft total braking distance}$$
