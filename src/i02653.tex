Suppose this current-to-pressure (I/P) transducer's relay vent becomes plugged with debris:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02653x01.eps}$$

\noindent
Choose the best answer to describe the effects of this fault:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} The coil current will rise all the way to full-range mA value
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The output pressure will rise all the way to full supply PSI 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} There will be no effect whatsoever -- all will continue as normal
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The coil current will fall all the way to zero mA 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The output pressure will fall all the way to zero PSI
\end{itemize}
