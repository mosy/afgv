This chemical reaction process combines two reactants, chemical {\bf A} and chemical {\bf B}, in a reactor vessel where they combine exothermically.  A constant flow of coolant through a ``jacket'' surrounding the reactor vessel removes excess heat to prevent combustion:

Three temperature switches connect to a PLC, triggering an automatic shutdown of the process if at least two of the three switches register excessive temperature (2oo3 shutdown).

\vskip 10pt

Determine the best fail-safe status for each of the three control valves shown in this P\&ID, as well as the best contact status ({\it normally open} or {\it normally closed}) for the temperature switches, assuming the goal is to avoid a high-temperature condition at any cost.  Also assume that the most likely kind of cable or switch contact failure is an electrical {\it open} rather than a short, and that such electrical faults in the switch circuits should result in the system shutting down just to be safe.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Chemical {\bf A} control valve: ({\it fail-open} or {\it fail-shut})
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Chemical {\bf B} control valve: ({\it fail-open} or {\it fail-shut})
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Coolant control valve: ({\it fail-open} or {\it fail-shut})
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Temperature switch status: ({\it normally-open} or {\it normally-closed})
\end{itemize}
