A vital principle to bear in mind with any 4-20 mA loop-powered transmitter circuit is that a loop-powered instrument acts as a {\it load} and not a {\it source}, even though it is the component regulating current.  Thus, a loop-powered transmitter drops voltage in the same manner that a resistor drops voltage (i.e. + on the side where conventional-flow current enters, - on the side where conventional-flow current exits).

This is just one possible solution:

Here is an alternative solution:

A good problem-solving technique to apply here is sketching arrows showing where conventional flow (current) enters and exits each component, based on its voltage polarity and its identity as either a source or a load.  Once these arrows are sketched, it becomes a trivial matter to connect tip-to-tail to form a series circuit:

$$\epsfbox{i02670x04.eps}$$

{\it Any} connections that put the tip of one arrow connecting the tail of another will form a valid series circuit!
