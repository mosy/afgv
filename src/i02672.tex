Sketch a circuit whereby two loop-powered pressure transmitters send signals to two isolated channels on a datalogger, a device that records electronic signals over long periods of time.  Include one DC power supply in your circuit, along with any other components necessary to make the two 4-20 mA loops work:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A good problem-solving technique to apply here is sketching the directions of current through each device (based on its voltage polarity marks and whether it is a {\it load} or a {\it source}).  Then, we will know how the wires must connect in order to keep all the arrows facing the same direction in series loops:

This is just one possible solution:

150 $\Omega$ is the {\it maximum} resistance value practical in this circuit, due to the upper limit of 3 volts on the datalogger.  This, of course, makes the calibrated range of measurement 0.6 volts to 3.0 volts between the datalogger terminals.
