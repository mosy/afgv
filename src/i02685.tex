The voltage across a discharging capacitor is given by the following formula, where $V_0$ is the initial (fully-charged) voltage, $t$ is time, and $\tau$ is the time constant of the RC discharge current path:
 
$$V = V_0 e^{- {t \over \tau}}$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $V_0$:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$V_0 = {V \over {e^{- {t \over \tau}}}} \hskip 30pt \hbox{or} \hskip 30pt V_0 = V e^{t \over \tau}$$
