The voltage-dependent capacitance of a {\it varactor diode} is given by the following formula, where $C_j$ is the junction capacitance at a specified bias voltage, $C_0$ is the junction capacitance at 0 volts, and $V$ is the voltage applied to the varactor diode's junction:

$$C_j = {C_0 \over {\sqrt{2V + 1}}}$$

Algebraically manipulate this formula to solve for $V$:
