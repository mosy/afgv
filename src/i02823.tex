Given the following pump curve for a water pump driven at a constant speed by an AC induction motor, determine the following:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02823x01.eps}$$

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Flow rate at a discharge head of 70 feet = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} GPM
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Discharge head at 112 GPM = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} feet
\end{itemize}

\underbar{file i02833}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Flow rate at a discharge head of 70 feet = \underbar{\bf 175} GPM
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Discharge head at 112 GPM = \underbar{\bf 127} feet
\end{itemize}
