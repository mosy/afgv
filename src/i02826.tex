This temperature control system has a problem.  The furnace is cold according to the operator who checked it personally, even though the indicating controller (TIC) shows that the furnace temperature is a full 1500 $^{o}$F.  A voltmeter connected between the ``+'' and ``$-$'' terminals on TY-205b registers 0.7 VDC:

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.
