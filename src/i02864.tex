Examine this single-line diagram of a power system and answer the following questions:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02864x01.eps}$$

Suppose Load F fails in such a way that it draws far more current than it should.  Identify which circuit breaker(s) must trip in order to interrupt the fault current while maintaining power to as many other loads as possible.

\vskip 10pt

Suppose circuit breaker \#5 fails to trip when commanded.  Identify which other circuit breaker(s) must trip in order to de-energize breaker \#5 while maintaining power to as many loads as possible.

\vskip 10pt

Suppose one of the high-voltage insulators on Bus C fails, causing a high amount of current to flow into that bus.  Identify which circuit breakers must trip in order to de-energize that bus while maintaining power to as many loads as possible.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Partial answer:}

\vskip 10pt

Fault on circuit breaker \#5: we will need to trip breakers {\it 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10}.  This will unfortunately interrupt power to loads {\it J, K, and L}.
 
%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

{\bf Fault on load F:} we will need to trip breakers {\it 3 and 7}.  This will unfortunately interrupt power to loads {\it D and E} as well.

\vskip 10pt

{\bf Fault on circuit breaker \#5:} we will need to trip breakers {\it 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10}.  This will unfortunately interrupt power to loads {\it J, K, and L}.
 
\vskip 10pt

{\bf Fault on Bus C:} we will need to trip breakers {\it 8, 9, 10, and 12}.  This will not interrupt power to any loads.

{\bf Summary Quiz:}

Identify the circuit breaker(s) which would have to trip in order to isolate a fault on Bus A:
