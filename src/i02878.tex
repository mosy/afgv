\noindent
Identify which protective relays in this system will trip breakers in the event of the following faults:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} A tree branch touching one of the power line conductors feeding Load B
\vskip 10pt
\item{} An internal phase-to-phase fault inside circuit breaker 4
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} A tree branch touching one of the power line conductors feeding Load B: {\it one of the overcurrent relays (50 or 51) at breaker 2 and/or breaker 6 depending on which of those two breakers is closed}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} An internal phase-to-phase fault inside circuit breaker 4: {\it the 87 (differential) relay immediately the West substation bus} 
\end{itemize}

Award partial credit (2 points) for the second answer if it cites one of the overcurrent relays monitoring breaker 4's current, rather than the differential relay which will be faster-acting.
