Explain the function of a {\it differential current relay} in a protective relay system.  In other words, describe what sort of dangerous condition this relay protects against and how it is able to accurately detect that condition in the power system.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A ``differential current'' or 87 relay exploits Kirchhoff's Current Law to detect unintentional current pathways within a defined zone of an electrical power system.  The principle is that current into a node should equal current out of a node.  The 87 relay monitors all currents entering and exiting a node and trips the circuit breaker(s) if those currents do not algebraically equal zero (i.e. if current has found some other pathway to flow).
