Calculate the temperature of the process if the voltmeter registers 48.872 mV when connected to the terminals in the RTD head:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02896x01.eps}$$

$T_{process}$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} degrees F

\underbar{file i02896}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$T_{process}$ = \underbar{\bf 135} degrees F (referencing an RTD table)
 
\vskip 10pt

$T_{process}$ = \underbar{\bf 135.7} degrees F (using the RTD formula)
