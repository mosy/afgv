In this process, maple syrup is heated as it passes through a steam heat exchanger, then enters an evaporator where the water boils off.  The purpose of this is to raise the sugar concentration of the syrup, making it suitable for use as a food topping.  A level control system (LT, LIR, LIC, and LV) maintains constant syrup level inside the evaporator, while an analytical control system (AT, AIR, AIC, and AV) monitors the sugar concentration of the syrup and adjusts steam flow to the heat exchanger accordingly.

Examine the live variable values shown in the above diagram, and then identify at least {\it two} plausible faults accounting for the system's status.  Be sure to explain why you think these things could be the cause of the problem.

The problem here is the AIC and its output signal.  Note how the lab's measured sugar concentration is well below the AIC's setpoint of 34\%, and how the AIC is sending out a saturated signal (over 15 PSI) to the control valve.  This suggests we might not have enough steam getting to the heat exchanger to evaporate water from the syrup.  Possibilities include:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Steam supply insufficient
\item{} Manual steam block valve pinched or shut off completely
\item{} Heat exchanger fouled
\item{} Condensate line to boiler plugged (not allowing flow)
\item{} Faulty control valve (AV)
\end{itemize}

Another possibility is a problem within the vapor compressor system, not drawing vapor off the evaporator vessel as it should despite adequate heating of the syrup.
