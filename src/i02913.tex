Here is an oscilloscope's view of an ASCII character (7 bits) sent asynchronously with odd parity and 1 stop bit (``7-O-1''), using {\it NRZ} (Non-Return to Zero) encoding:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02913x01.eps}$$

Identify the specific ASCII character represented by the data in this frame, and determine whether or not the parity checks out okay.

\underbar{file i02913}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is the ASCII character for a semicolon (;), and the parity checks out okay.
