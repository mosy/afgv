Some units of pressure measurement maybe used to express either gauge pressure or absolute pressure.  Pounds per square inch (PSI) is one of those versatile units: we can express a pressure either in terms of PSIG (PSI gauge pressure) or PSIA (PSI absolute pressure).

However, there are some other units of pressure measurement that may only be used to express absolute pressure.  In other words, there are some {\it intrinsically absolute} pressure units.  Identify these particular pressure units.
