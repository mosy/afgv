The following illustration shows a rather strange manometer, one with two different liquids inside, coupled by a hand valve:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02952x01.eps}$$

If the two columns of liquid are just right, they will remain at their respective (different) heights when the valve is opened.  Unlike a normal manometer where the two liquid columns always equalize to the same height when vented, this manometer is ``content'' to rest at different heights.  Explain why.

\vskip 10pt

Also, calculate two possible heights that will balance each other, given the liquids of water and glycerine.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

19 inches of water and 15 inches of glycerine will balance one another in this manometer.  These are not the only column heights that will self-balance.  In fact, any ratio of 19:15 will work because the ratio of water's density to glycerine's density is 15:19.
