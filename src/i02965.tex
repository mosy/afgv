Draw the appropriate pressure switch symbol in this ladder-logic diagram for a {\it low-pressure alarm} which turns on a lamp if the oil pressure of an industrial machine ever drops below 10 PSI:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02965x01.eps}$$

Be sure to specify whether the pressure switch needs to be {\it normally-open} (NC) or {\it normally-closed} (NC).
