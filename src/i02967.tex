{\it Limit switches} are often used on the doors of electrical enclosures and cabinets to automatically shut off power or shut down a machine's function if anyone opens the door for maintenance purposes.  The limit switch is typically mounted in such a way that a shut door holds the switch lever in the ``actuated'' position.  When the door opens wide, the limit switch lever is released and the switch returns to its ``normal'' status.

Draw the appropriate limit switch symbol in this ladder logic diagram so that the control circuit (shown as a rectangular box) gets shut down if ever someone opens the cabinet door:

Be sure to denote whether this limit switch needs to be normally-open (N.O.) or normally-closed (N.C.).
