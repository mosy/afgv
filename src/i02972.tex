How many reference junctions does this thermocouple circuit have, and where exactly are they located?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This circuit only has one reference junction, if you count the two terminal connections at the indicator as a single junction.  The junction mid-way between the thermocouple head and the indicator is not a reference junction because it is not a junction of dissimilar metals. 

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Likewise, the junction at the thermocouple head is also {\it not} a reference junction because it joins like metals.  Either of these junctions could be considered reference junctions if dissimilar metal wires were being joined.
