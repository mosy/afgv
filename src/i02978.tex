Calculate the pressure at the discharge end of this pipe ($P_2$), assuming water as the fluid (with a mass density $\rho$ = 1.951 slugs/ft$^{3}$), 32.2 ft/s$^{2}$ as the acceleration of gravity ($g$), and frictionless flow (no pressure loss due to friction):

Express your answer in units of PSI as well as PSF (pounds per square foot).

{\bf Bernoulli's equation:}

$$z_1 \rho g + {v_1^2 \rho \over 2} + P_1 = z_2 \rho g + {v_2^2 \rho \over 2} + P_2$$
