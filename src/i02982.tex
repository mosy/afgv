Calculate the pressure developed by a Pitot tube measuring air speed at 50 MPH, at sea level ($\rho_{air}$ = 0.00235 slugs/ft$^{3}$).

\vskip 10pt

Also, how much pressure will the Pitot tube develop at twice the air speed (100 MPH)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$P$ at 50 MPH = 1.215 inches H$_{2}$O

\vskip 10pt

$P$ at 100 MPH = 4.859 inches H$_{2}$O
