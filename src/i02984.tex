Calculate the differential pressure developed by an open venturi tube measuring air speed at 80 km/h, at sea level ($\rho_{air}$ =1.21114 kg/mÂ³, where the throat diameter is one-half that of the entrance diameter:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02984x01.eps}$$

Also, how much pressure will the venturi tube develop at twice the air speed (160 km/h)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)


$\Delta P$ at 80 km/h = 4485.6 Pa 
\vskip 10pt

$\Delta P$ at 160 km/h =  17942 Pa
