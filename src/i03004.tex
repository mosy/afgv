What does it mean if a particular sample of ethyl alcohol has a {\it molarity} of 0.1 $M$, or 0.1 molar?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

For a solution of 0.1 molar (0.1 $M$) concentration, there are 0.1 moles of solute (pure ethyl alcohol) for every 1 liter of total solution volume.  It should be noted that the molarity of a solution changes with temperature, because a solution's volume will change with temperature even though the quantity of solute in moles does not!
