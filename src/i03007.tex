Suppose an NDIR gas analyzer is proposed for measuring the concentration of methane (CH$_{4}$) gas in a stream containing a high percentage of acetylene (C$_{2}$H$_{2}$) gas.  The infrared spectra of these two gases are shown below:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03007x01.eps}$$

Identify the gases that should fill each of the cells in this NDIR analyzer:

\vskip 10pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Reference cell: \underbar{\hskip 50pt} gas
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Luft detector cells: \underbar{\hskip 50pt} gas
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Filter cells: \underbar{\hskip 50pt} gas {\it or} not necessary at all?
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

If you have reason to believe that the proposed measurement scenario is \underbar{impossible} given these spectra, explain why you think so.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Reference cell: \underbar{\bf non-absorbing} gas such as {\bf nitrogen}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Luft detector cells: \underbar{\bf methane} (CH$_{4}$) gas
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Filter cells: \underbar{\bf acetylene} (C$_{2}$H$_{2}$) gas
\end{itemize}

2 points for reference cell gas, 4 points for Luft detector gas, 4 points for filter cell gas.
