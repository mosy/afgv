%(BEGIN_NOTES)

``Dead tank'' refers to the potential of the contact housing: in this case the breaker's metal housing is connected to earth ground and is therefore ``dead''.

\vskip 10pt

The current-interrupting contacts are located in the horizontal tube section (the ``dead'' tank) while the disconnect and earthing contacts are located in the insulators.  The ``earthing'' switch connects the interrupting contacts to earth ground for maintenance purposes.
