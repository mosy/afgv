State your answers both in symbolic form (e.g. ??? volts $\angle$ ?? degrees) as well as in a phasor diagram along with these generator voltage phasors:

Calculating the series impedance of each resistor-capacitor pair:

$$Z = Z_R + Z_C$$

$$Z = (R \> \Omega \angle 0^o) + \left({1 \over {2 \pi f C}} \Omega \angle -90^o \right)$$

$$Z = (15 \> \Omega \angle 0^o) + \left({1 \over {(2) (\pi) (60) (30 \times 10^{-6})}} \Omega \angle -90^o \right)$$

$$Z = (15 \> \Omega \angle 0^o) + (88.419 \> \Omega \angle -90^o)$$

$$Z = 15 - j88.419 \> \Omega$$

$$Z = 89.683 \> \Omega \angle -80.37^o$$

The amount of phase voltage seen by each of the RC loads is simply the line voltage (2.4 kV) divided by the square root of 3.  In this case, 1.386 kV.

Calculating each phase current:

$$I_A = {V_A \over Z_A} = {1386.64 \hbox{ V} \angle 0^o \over 89.683 \> \Omega \angle -80.37^o} = 15.45 \hbox{ A} \angle 80.37^o$$

$$I_B = {V_B \over Z_B} = {1386.64 \hbox{ V} \angle -120^o \over 89.683 \> \Omega \angle -80.37^o} = 15.45 \hbox{ A} \angle -39.63^o$$

$$I_C = {V_C \over Z_C} = {1386.64 \hbox{ V} \angle 120^o \over 89.683 \> \Omega \angle -80.37^o} = 15.45 \hbox{ A} \angle -159.63^o$$
