The following loop diagram documents a wastewater pH neutralization system, adding acid or caustic as needed to the water to maintain a relatively neutral pH level:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03093x01.eps}$$

Determine the following parameters within this system, assuming a controller output of 46\%, a measured pH of 6.85, and negligible wire resistance:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Voltage between terminals 22 and 21 on the controller = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} V
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Voltage between terminals 3 and 4 of terminal block TB-2 = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} V
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Which control valve is completely shut: the {\it caustic valve} or the {\it acid valve} ?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Position of open valve = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \% open 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Direction that integral control action will drive the controller output, assuming a setpoint of 8 pH: {\it increase} or {\it decrease}?
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Voltage between terminals 22 and 21 on the controller = \underbar{\bf 2.957} V
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Voltage between terminals 3 and 4 of terminal block TB-2 = \underbar{\bf 3.9987} V
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Which control valve is completely shut: the {\bf acid valve}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Position of open valve = \underbar{\bf 8}\% open 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Direction that integral control action will drive the controller output, assuming a setpoint of 8 pH: {\bf decrease} (adding more caustic to the water)
\end{itemize}
