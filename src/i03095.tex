The {\tt grades\_template} spreadsheet provided for you on the Y: network drive allows you to calculate your grade for any course (by entering exam scores, attendance data, etc.) as well as project to the future for courses you have not yet taken.

Download the spreadsheet file (if you have not done so yet) and enter your scores for this course (INST200 -- Introduction to Instrumentation) to calculate the grade you will receive.
