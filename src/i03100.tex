This protective relay circuit has a problem.  During the last fault, it successfully tripped the circuit breaker, but the relay never registered the change in breaker status (from closed to tripped) -- instead it continued to show the breaker as remaining in the {\it closed} state.  The indicator lamp functions just fine.

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!

Finally, identify the {\it next} diagnostic test or measurement you would make on this system.  Explain how the result(s) of this next test or measurement help further identify the location and/or nature of the fault.

A good ``next test'' would be to measure voltage at the relay's IN1 input terminals: between terminals C and D.  The presence of voltage (with the breaker tripped) indicates a shorted 52a-1 contact.  The absence of voltage indicates a failed relay input.
