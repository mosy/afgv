In this system, an Allen-Bradley SLC 500 PLC acts as a temperature controller, turning a cooling water solenoid valve on and off to modulate water flow to the heat-exchange jacket of a chemical reactor vessel.  A thermocouple monitors the temperature of the fluids within the vessel.  This diagram shows only the electrical connections (no piping, no other components represented) for simplicity:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03112x01.eps}$$

One day the operator of this reactor contacts you to say the reactor is overheating, based on the indication of a temperature gauge installed in the reactor near the PLC's thermocouple.  The reactor temperature high/low setpoint values programmed in the PLC are 85 deg C and 80 deg C, respectively.  The temperature gauge is registering 91 deg C and slowly climbing.

Identify some likely faults that could cause this situation to occur, and also identify what tests you would begin to conduct in order to diagnose the problem.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Possible faults include (but are not limited to):
 
\begin{itemize}
\item{} PLC program halted (with output {\tt O:3/3} stuck in the ``off'' state)
\item{} Discrete output {\tt O:3/3} channel bad (open TRIAC)
\item{} Short-circuit in thermocouple cable, causing it to register ambient temperature (low)
\item{} Failed thermocouple input {\tt I:2.1} channel, registering low temperature
\item{} 120 VAC power to PLC failed (e.g. breaker CB-5 tripped)
\item{} Cooling water supply failed
\item{} Solenoid valve stuck shut
\item{} Open wire fault between solenoid valve and PLC output card
\end{itemize}
