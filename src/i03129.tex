Suppose the solenoid valve refuses to energize when the pushbutton switch is pressed.  A voltmeter registers 0 volts between test points {\bf C} and {\bf E} in the circuit while the pushbutton is released (i.e. not being pressed):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03129x01.eps}$$

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.
