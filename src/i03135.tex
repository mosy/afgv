In machining production technology, the time required to ``broach'' a hole in a plate may be estimated by the following equation:

$$T = {L \over C} + {L \over R_c}$$

\noindent
Where,

$T =$ Time to broach hole (minutes)

$L =$ Length of stroke (feet)

$C =$ Cutting speed (feet per minute)

$R_c =$ Return speed (feet per minute)

\vskip 30pt

Manipulate this equation to solve for $L$, and again to solve for $R_c$.  Be sure to show all your work!

\vskip 50pt

$L = $

\vskip 100pt

$R_c = $

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$$L = {{T C R_c} \over {R_c + C}}$$

$$R_c = {{L C} \over {T C - L}}$$

To solve this problem, you must not only make common the unlike denominators in the original equation, but you must also use factoring to consolidate variables.
