In this equation there is a {\bf mistake}:

$${6 \over x + 2} - {{x - 4} \over {x + 2}} = {{6 - x - 4} \over {x + 2}}$$

\vskip 30pt

Identify the mistake, and re-write the right-hand side of the equation so the two sides are truly equal.  Be sure to show all your work!

\vskip 50pt

$${6 \over x + 2} - {{x - 4} \over {x + 2}} = $$

$${6 \over x + 2} - {{x - 4} \over {x + 2}}$$

$${{6  - (x - 4)} \over {x + 2}}$$

$${{6 - x + 4} \over {x + 2}}$$

$${{10 - x} \over {x + 2}}$$

The ``$-$'' sign was not properly distributed in the erroneous equation.
