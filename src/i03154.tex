The {\it Nernst equation} is the primary formula used to predict voltage generated across an ion-selective membrane due to ion exchange from one side of the membrane to the other.  This equation is commonly used to predict the amount of voltage generated by a pH electrode pair, when measuring the pH of an aqueous (water-based) solution:

$$V = {{2.303 R T} \over {nF}} \log \left({C_1 \over C_2}\right)$$

\noindent
Where,

$V$ = Voltage produced across membrane due to ion exchange, in volts (V)

$R$ = Universal gas constant (8.315 J/mol$\cdot$K)

$T$ = Absolute temperature, in Kelvin (K)

$n$ = Number of electrons transferred per ion exchanged (unitless)

$F$ = Faraday constant, in coulombs per mole (96,485 C/mol e$^{-}$)

$C_1$ = Concentration of ion in measured solution, in moles per liter of solution ($M$)

$C_2$ = Concentration of ion in reference solution (on other side of membrane), in moles per liter of solution ($M$)

\vskip 20pt

How much voltage will develop across a membrane when the ion concentrations ($C_1$ and $C_2$) are precisely equal on both sides of the membrane?

\vskip 20pt

What condition is necessary to generate a {\it positive} voltage across the membrane, according to the equation?

\vskip 20pt

What condition is necessary to generate a {\it negative} voltage across the membrane, according to the equation?

How much voltage will develop across a membrane when the ion concentrations ($C_1$ and $C_2$) are precisely equal on both sides of the membrane?  $V$ = zero

\vskip 20pt

What condition is necessary to generate a {\it positive} voltage across the membrane, according to the equation?  $C_1 > C_2$, because logarithm functions produce positive values only when they are given values greater than one.

\vskip 20pt

What condition is necessary to generate a {\it negative} voltage across the membrane, according to the equation?  $C_2 > C_1$, because logarithm functions produce negative values only when they are given values less than one.
