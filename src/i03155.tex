Suppose a municipal water treatment facility requires four ``nines'' of security for its electric power service (99.99\% probability of power availability).  The local electric utility has a demonstrated annual security of only three ``nines'' (99.9\% available) and so the decision is made to install a backup diesel generator at the water treatment facility capable of supplying adequate electric power to the facility in the event of a utility outage.

Calculate the necessary reliability of this diesel generator unit, in order to give the water treatment 99.99\% electric power security year-round.

This is an ``inclusive-OR'' probability situation, where either the electric utility {\it or} the diesel generator {\it or both} must be available in order to ensure power for the water treatment facility:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03155x01.eps}$$

Calculating such an OR probability is done using this formula:

$$P(A \hbox{ or } B) = P(B) + P(A) - P(A) \times P(B)$$

In this scenario, $P(A \hbox{ or } B)$ is the desired security of the electric power at the water treatment facility, while $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ represent the individual probabilities of the electric utility and the diesel generator providing power.  If we let $P(A)$ be the reliability of the generator, we see the equation simplify to this:

$$0.9999 = 0.999 + P(A) - \left[ 0.999 P(A)\right]$$

$$0.9999 = 0.999 + 0.001 P(A)$$

$$0.0009 = 0.001 P(A)$$

$$P(A) = 0.9$$

Thus, the diesel generator must be at least 90\% reliable in order to adequately supplement the local utility's power.
