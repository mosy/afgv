The following lamp circuit has a problem.  The lamp refuses to turn on, no matter what position the switch is set in:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03160x01.eps}$$

With the switch in the {\it on} position, you measure normal battery voltage between terminals {\bf 1} and {\bf 4} on the terminal block.  Based on this information, identify which of these proposed faults could possibly account for the observed behavior of this circuit and which could not.  Consider each fault one at a time (in other words, ask yourself whether or not each proposed fault -- by itself -- could account for the behavior of the circuit):

\begin{itemize}
%\item{} Lamp failed open (filament broken in half) -- {\it possible} or {\it not possible}?
\item{} Switch failed open (contacts dirty or corroded) -- {\it possible} or {\it not possible}? 
\item{} Switch failed shorted (contacts welded together) -- {\it possible} or {\it not possible}? 
%\item{} Broken wire between lamp and switch -- {\it possible} or {\it not possible}?
%\item{} Broken wire between switch and terminal block -- {\it possible} or {\it not possible}?
\item{} Broken wire between terminal block and battery -- {\it possible} or {\it not possible}?
\item{} Broken wire between terminal block and lamp -- {\it possible} or {\it not possible}?
%\item{} Completely dead battery -- {\it possible} or {\it not possible}?
\end{itemize}
