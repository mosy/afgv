Do radio waves suffer more or less degradation in power as they spread out over long distances if they have higher frequencies or lower frequencies, or is frequency completely unrelated to power degradation?  Defend your answer mathematically.

\vskip 10pt

Do the Fresnel zones of radio waves occupy more or less space as their frequencies increase?  Defend your answer mathematically.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

According to the formula for calculating {\it path loss} of an RF signal, the amount of attenuation over distance {\it increases} with increasing signal frequency.  This is because a greater frequency (greater $f$) results in a shorter wavelength (smaller $\lambda$), which makes $L_p$ a more negative value (greater loss):

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
Path loss formula:

$$L_p = -20 \log \left(4 \pi D \over \lambda\right)$$

\noindent
Where,

$L_p$ = Path loss, a negative dB value

$D$ = Distance between transmitting and receiving antennas

$\lambda$ = Wavelength of transmitted RF field, in same physical unit as $D$

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
The formula for calculating wavelength is shown here.  For radio waves, the propagation velocity is the speed of light ($2.99792 \times 10^8$ meters per second, commonly represented as $c$), and the frequency is expressed in Hertz:

$$\lambda = {c \over f}$$

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
Conversely, the Fresnel zone of a radio wave ``tightens'' to occupy a smaller space as signal frequency increases.  This is due to wavelength ($\lambda$) being in the numerator of the fraction used to calculate Fresnel zone radius, with that wavelength parameter decreasing in magnitude as signal frequency increases:

$$r = \sqrt{n \lambda d_1 d_2 \over D}$$
