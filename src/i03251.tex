Sketch the necessary wiring to make this pressure switch control two lamps in the following manner:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} High process pressure: green lamp on and red lamp off
\item{} Low process pressure: red lamp on and green lamp off
\end{itemize}

Hint: remember that the ``normal'' status of a switch is defined as the status of {\it minimum stimulus}: when the switch is exposed to the lowest possible degree of process stimulation (in this particular case, to the lowest possible pressure).
