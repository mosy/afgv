Suppose a waveguide receives 0.83 megawatts of RF power from a radar transceiver at one end, and delivers 0.79 megawatts of RF power to a radar antenna at the other end.  Express each of these power figures in dBW, and then express the power loss of this waveguide in dB.

\vskip 10pt

Also, calculate the loss of the waveguide in decibels per foot, assuming it is 40 feet long.

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Estimate these decibel values by first rounding the power ratio to the nearest product of 10 and/or 2, then applying the equivalence of 10 dB to a 10-fold ratio and 3 dB to a 2-fold ratio.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$P_{in}$ = 59.19 dBW

\vskip 10pt

$P_{out}$ = 58.98 dBW

\vskip 10pt

Waveguide loss = $-0.2145$ dB 

\vskip 10pt

Waveguide loss = $-0.00536$ dB per foot
