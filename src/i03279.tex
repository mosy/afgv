Qualitatively graph the response of an hypothetical derivative-only controller over time to the following changes in process variable:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03279x01.eps}$$

Assume {\it reverse} control action.
 
\underbar{file i03279}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The controller output graph shown here is {\it qualitative} only.  Although drawn to scale (i.e. all changes in the output are properly scaled relative to each other), the scale itself is arbitrary and therefore may not match the scale of your sketch:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03279x02.eps}$$
