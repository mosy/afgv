%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here is one way to solve this problem: solve for $x$ in the second equation, then substitute this definition for $x$ everywhere $x$ appears in the first equation:

\vskip 10pt

First, solving for $x$:

$$x + 2y = 1$$

$$x = 1 - 2y$$

Next, substituting $1 - 2y$ as a ``definition'' of $x$ into the first equation: 

$$3x - y = 17$$

$$3(1 - 2y) - y = 17$$

Note how we now have one equation with just one variable ($y$).  This means we are now able to solve for the value of $y$:

$$3 - 6y - y = 17$$

$$3 - 7y = 17$$

$$7y = 3 - 17$$

$$7y = -14$$

$$y = -2$$

\vskip 10pt

Once we have this numerical value for $y$, we can substitute it into the manipulated second equation to solve for $x$:

$$x = 1 - 2y$$

$$x = 1 - 2(-2)$$

$$x = 1 + 4$$

$$x = 5$$

So, our final solutions for $x$ and $y$ that will satisfy both equations are $x = 5$ and $y = -2$.
