Determine the output signal magnitude for each computational relay shown:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03293x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file i03293}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03293x02.eps}$$

Note that the placement of each input signal is irrelevant to the selection of that signal.  Only the signals' values matter!
