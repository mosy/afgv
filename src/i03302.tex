Qualitatively graph the response of an {\it integral-only} controller over time to the changes in process variable shown here:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03302x01.eps}$$

Assume {\it reverse} control action.

\underbar{file i03302}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The controller output graph shown here is {\it qualitative} only.  Although drawn to scale (i.e. all changes in the output are properly scaled relative to each other), the scale itself is arbitrary and therefore may not match the scale of your sketch:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03302x02.eps}$$
