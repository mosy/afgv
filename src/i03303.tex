Qualitatively graph the individual proportional, integral, and derivative responses of a PID controller to the following input conditions, assuming {\it reverse} controller action.  Use a solid line for proportional, a dashed line for integral, and a dotted line for derivative:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03303x01.eps}$$

Then, draw a final graph of the controller's output, showing how the P, I, and D terms would combine to form a composite waveform:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03303x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file i03303}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The controller output graph shown here is {\it qualitative} only.  Although drawn to scale (i.e. all changes in the output are properly scaled relative to each other), the scale itself is arbitrary and therefore may not match the scale of your sketch:
