Determine the output voltage $V_{X}$ for this three-phase transformer bank, as well as the phase rotation for the low-voltage bus (either {\it XYZ} or {\it ZYX}), given a HV bus phase voltage of 4160 volts and ABC phase rotation ($V_A$ = 4160 V $\angle$ $0^o$):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03310x01.eps}$$

Be sure to show the phase angle for $V_X$ as well as its magnitude!

\vskip 10pt

$V_X$ = \underbar{\hskip 80pt}  \hskip 100pt Phase rotation = {\it XYZ} or {\it ZYX}
