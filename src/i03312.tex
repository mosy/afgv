A current transformer with a C400 class rating and a 600:5 ratio is used to measure current through a power line where the maximum symmetrical fault current is 11 kA and the relay burden is 0.5 ohms (resistive).  The CT's secondary winding resistance is 0.25 ohms.  Assume no DC transients in this power system and 1000 feet of distance between the CT and the relay (2000 feet total wire length).

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the maximum amount of resistance for the wire connecting the CT to the relay not exceeding the CT's rated capability, and then choose the {\it smallest} copper wire gauge size satisfying this criterion:

\vskip 10pt

$R_{wire}$ (maximum) = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} $\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} 6 AWG
\item{} 8 AWG
\item{} 10 AWG
\item{} 12 AWG
\item{} 14 AWG
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_{wire}$ (maximum) = \underbar{\bf 3.886} $\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

{\bf 12 AWG} is the minimum wire size necessary in this application.
