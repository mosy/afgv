%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A ``lockout'' or 86 relay serves as an intermediate component between one or more protective relays and one or more circuit breakers and/or other functions.  The term ``lockout'' refers to the fact that the 86 relay remains in the tripped position until a human operator manually resets it, thus ``locking out'' the circuit breaker(s) being tripped.
