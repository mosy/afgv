Suppose the switch has been left in the ``up'' position (as shown in the diagram) for a long time, and then is suddenly toggled to the ``down'' position:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03341x01.eps}$$

Moments after the switch transitions to its new state, sketch the following on the schematic diagram:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Voltage polarity across the capacitor (+ and $-$ symbols)
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Voltage polarity across the current-carrying resistor (+ and $-$ symbols)
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Direction of current through the resistor (arrow pointing in the direction of conventional flow)
\end{itemize}
