Calculate the following parameters in this balanced 3-phase power system, assuming a source phase voltage of 220 VAC and a load phase resistance of 29 ohms:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03368x01.eps}$$

$V_{line}$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} volts

\vskip 10pt

$I_{line}$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} amps

\vskip 10pt

$I_{phase}$ (source) = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} amps

\underbar{file i03368}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{line}$ = \underbar{\bf 220} volts

$I_{line}$ = \underbar{\bf 4.380} amps

$I_{phase}$ (source) = \underbar{\bf 2.529} amps
