Qualitatively graph the individual proportional, integral, and derivative responses of a PID controller as it experiences a step-change in process variable (PV):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03370x01.eps}$$

Assume {\it direct} controller action.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Do your best to describe each action (P, I, and D) {\it verbally}, as though you are explaining each one to someone for the first time.  Keep your explanations as simple as you can without sacrificing technical accuracy.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The controller output graph shown here is {\it qualitative} only.  Although drawn to scale (i.e. all changes in the output are properly scaled relative to each other), the scale itself is arbitrary and therefore may not match the scale of your sketch:
