Suppose a radio telemetry system is upgraded from 900 MHz to 2.4 GHz, with all antennas, cables, and other equipment replaced to accommodate the new signal frequency.  Assuming all cable losses and antenna gains are the same as they were before, calculate the change in path loss resulting from the shift in frequency.  Will there be more path loss than before, less path loss than before, or the same amount of path loss as before?  If there is a change in path loss, exactly how much change will there be?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

3 points for identifying the correct direction of change, and 7 points for calculating the correct magnitude (either in units of dB or as a ratio or percentage)

\vskip 10pt

An increase in freqeuncy will result in greater path loss.  Specifically, the new path loss will be -8.519 dB from what it was before (i.e. the received signal strength at 2.4 GHz will be only 14.06\% of what it was before at 900 MHz).
