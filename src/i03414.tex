Suppose you are asked to install lightning arrestors at both the MTU and the RTU in a two-station radio SCADA system.  Each arrestor has an advertised power loss of $-0.55$ dB.  If the current transmitter output power is 3.2 milliwatts, how much more powerful will it need to be in order to overcome the new losses resulting from the installation of these lightning arrestors and achieve the exact same performance as it did without the arrestors in place?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Adding lightning arrestors to the system makes the signal path suffer an addition power loss of $-1.1$ dB.  This equates to a power ratio of:

$$10^{-1.1 \over 10} = 0.7762$$

Therefore, the new transmitter output power will need to be $1 \over 0.7762$ times stronger than the old transmitter output power:

$${1 \over 0.7762} \times 3.2 \hbox{ mW} = 4.122 \hbox{ mW}$$

$P_{tx}$ = 4.122 milliwatts
