Suppose an RTU in a radio SCADA system is able to receive an RF signal strength of 0.17 microwatts from the MTU using a standard ``whip'' antenna with a gain of 5.8 dBi.  If you were to replace this whip antenna with a Yagi having a gain of 11.4 dBi, how much signal power would the RTU receive?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Replacing the low-gain antenna (5.8 dBi) with a high-gain antenna (11.4 dBi) adds 5.6 more decibels of gain to the overall system.  This equates to a power ratio of:

$$10^{5.6 \over 10} = 3.631$$

Therefore, the new receiver signal power will be 3.631 times stronger than the old receiver signal power:

$$3.631 \times 0.17 \> \mu\hbox{W} = 0.617 \> \mu\hbox{W}$$

$P_{rx}$ = 0.617 microwatts
