Two flowmeters are used to simultaneously measure the flow rate of a liquid through a pipe:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03425x01.eps}$$

Suppose the thermal flowmeter's measurement increases while the positive displacement flowmeter's measurement decreases at the same time.  Would this indicate a {\it increase} or a {\it decrease} in liquid density?  Explain your answer in detail.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The liquid density has {\bf increased}, because the thermal flowmeter shows more mass flow while the positive displacement flowmeter shows less volumetric flow.

I recommend awarding half-credit for the increase/decrease answer, and half-credit for a correct written explanation.
