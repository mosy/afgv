Suppose a radio receiver unit is equipped with a lightning arrestor that presents a signal power attenuation of $-0.4$ dB.  During a storm, this arrestor is damaged.  Lacking a replacement on hand, you decide to remove it from the system and re-connect the antenna directly to the receiver with no lighting arrestor at all, at least until you can purchase and install a new arrestor.

\vskip 10pt

Supposing this receiver was able to gather an RF signal of 0.8 microwatts with the arrestor in place, calculate the new signal power level without the arrestor, assuming all other factors remain the same as before (e.g. same transmitter power, same path loss, same environmental conditions, etc.):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Removing the arrestor from the system essentially added a +0.4 dB gain compared to the performance of the old system (with the arrestor in place).  This much gain expressed as a ratio is:

$$10^{0.4 \over 10} = 1.096$$

Therefore, the new receiver signal power will be 1.096 times stronger than the old receiver signal power:

$$1.096 \times 0.8 \> \mu\hbox{W} = 0.8772 \> \mu\hbox{W}$$

$P_{rx}$ = 0.8772 microwatts
