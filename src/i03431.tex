A radio transmitter equipped with a high-gain (13.5 dBi) Yagi antenna is able to deliver an RF signal power of 2.4 microwatts ($P_{rx}$ = 2.4 $\mu$W) to a receiver located some distance away.  One night, a falling tree branch damages the Yagi antenna during a fierce wind storm, forcing you to temporarily replace the damaged antenna with the only one you have on hand: a half-wave whip having a gain of only 6 dBi.  Calculate the new RF signal power level at the receiver, assuming all other factors have remained unchanged (i.e. only the transmitting antenna is different).
