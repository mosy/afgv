A Pitot tube measuring the flow of glycerin (78.6 lb/ft$^{3}$) produces a differential pressure of 35 inches W.C. at a mass flow rate of 450 pounds per minute.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the differential pressure produced by this same Pitot tube at a flow rate of 310 lb/min.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the mass flow rate at a differential pressure of 12.6 "WC.

\vskip 10pt

If the glycerin density happens to change from 78.6 lb/ft$^{3}$ to 75.1 lb/ft$^{3}$, calculate the mass flow rate at a differential pressure of 24.8 "WC.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Differential pressure produced by this same Pitot tube at a flow rate of 310 lb/min = {\bf 16.61 "WC}

\vskip 10pt

Mass flow rate at a differential pressure of 12.6 "WC = {\bf 270 lb/min}

\vskip 10pt

Mass flow rate at DP of 24.8 "WC, assuming density of 75.1 lb/ft$^{3}$ = {\bf 370.3 lb/min}
