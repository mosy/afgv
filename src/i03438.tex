An architect is designing a house, where the heat loss through one particular wall needs to be no more than 500 BTU/hour during the wintertime (average outside temperature = 25 deg F, inside temperature = 70 deg F) in order to meet new energy-efficiency certification requirements.  Assuming a rectangular wall with a width of 35 feet and a height of 9 feet, calculate the required thickness of foam board insulation assuming an insulating value of R-5 per inch of thickness.

\vskip 10pt

Thickness ($x$) = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} inches

\vskip 10pt

Finally, write a single formula solving for this thickness value ($x$) in terms of heat loss rate ($dQ \over dt$), outside temperature ($T_{out}$), inside temperature ($T_{in}$), wall area ($A$), and insulation R-value per inch of foam thickness (``R'' per inch = $F$).  Note that the actual insulation value ($R$) will not appear in your equation:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Thickness ($x$) = \underbar{\bf 5.67} inches

\vskip 10pt

$$x = {{A (T_{in} - T_{out})} \over {F {dQ \over dt}}}$$

\vskip 10pt

5 points for correct thickness, 5 points for correct formula.
