%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Advantages of hydrostatic over ultrasonic: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Not affected by layers of foam
\item{} May be used to measure high-pressure processes
\item{} Not affected by changes in gas pressure or composition
\item{} Easy to calibrate
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Advantages of ultrasonic over hydrostatic:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Not affected by changes in liquid density
\item{} Can be completely non-contact (for highly corrosive processes)
\item{} Will not experience plugging from solids in liquid
\end{itemize}
