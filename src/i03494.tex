In this ``inverting'' DC-DC converter circuit, a transistor is alternately switched on and off to control the storage and release of energy in an inductor, thus controlling the average voltage delivered to the load:

During the transistor's {\it on} period, sketch the following on the schematic diagram:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Voltage polarity across the inductor (+ and $-$ symbols)
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Voltage polarity across the diode (+ and $-$ symbols)
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Direction of current through the capacitor (arrow pointing in the direction of conventional flow)
\end{itemize}
