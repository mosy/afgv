The following equation relates torque ($\tau$, which is the twisting force) and radius ($r$) of two meshing gears:

$${\tau_1 \over r_1} = {\tau_2 \over r_2}$$

A student attempts to manipulate this equation to solve for $r_1$, and gets this incorrect result:

$$r_1 = {\tau_2 \over {\tau_1 r_2}}$$

Explain exactly where the student went wrong in solving for $r_1$, then properly solve for $r_1$.  Be sure to show all your work!
