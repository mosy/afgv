When pentane (C$_{5}$H$_{12}$) is burned with oxygen (O$_{2}$) under ideal conditions, the products are water vapor (H$_{2}$O) and carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$).  Write a balanced equation showing all reactants and all reaction products in the proper proportions.

\vskip 50pt

Also, identify whether pentane is a {\it paraffin}, an {\it olefin}, or an {\it aromatic} compound.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\hbox{C}_5\hbox{H}_{12} + \hbox{8O}_2 \to \hbox{6H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{5CO}_2$$

\vskip 10pt

Pentane is a {\bf paraffinic} compound.
