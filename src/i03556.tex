Suppose a DP transmitter with a calibrated range of -30 to +30 inches water column (4 to 20 mA output) is subjected to the following pressure:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03556x01.eps}$$

Calculate the voltage dropped by the resistor:

\vskip 10pt

$V$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} volts (no transmitter error)

\vskip 30pt

Now suppose the transmitter has a ``zero shift'' error of +2\% of span (i.e. its output signal is 2\% of span greater than it should be at all points along its calibrated range).  Re-calculate the voltage dropped by the resistor:

\vskip 10pt

$V$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} volts (with +2\% transmitter error)

\underbar{file i03556}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
5 points for each answer:

\vskip 10pt

$V$ = \underbar{\bf 1.76} volts (no transmitter error)

$V$ = \underbar{\bf 1.866} volts (with +2\% transmitter error)
