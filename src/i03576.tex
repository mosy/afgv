Determine the amount of air pressure applied to this piezoresistive pressure sensor, assuming the sensor has a linear response to pressure (1 k$\Omega$ at 0 PSI, 2 k$\Omega$ at 5 PSI, 3 k$\Omega$ at 10 PSI, 4 k$\Omega$ at 15 PSI) and the output voltage signal is 0.85 volts:

$P$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} PSI

\vskip 10pt

Also, determine if the signal voltage will {\it increase} or {\it decrease} as pressure increases.

Half credit for each answer:

\vskip 10pt

$P$ = \underbar{\bf 7.196} PSI

(Deduct 3 points if the answer was derived graphically rather than analytically)

\vskip 10pt

The signal voltage will {\bf increase} as applied pressure increases.
