Draw the necessary connecting wires, and any additional electronic components necessary (complete with values if applicable), to make the loop-powered transmitter input a signal to channel Ain2 of the DAQ unit.  Assume an analog input range of 0 to +3.2 volts (i.e. full 20 mA signal from the transmitter should not produce a voltage at the DAQ input more than +3.2 volts, Ain2 terminal positive with respect to ground):
