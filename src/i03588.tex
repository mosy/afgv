Motor contactors (also called motor {\it starters}) are large, electromechanical relays used to turn three-phase electric power on and off to large AC motors.  Contactors inevitably produce sparks when operating due to the (normally) high currents drawn by the motors, and therefore pose a hazard in classified areas.

Identify {\bf two} techniques that could be used to minimize the danger of a motor contactor triggering an explosion if the contactor itself {\it absolutely must} be located in a Class 1, Division 1 area.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

One solution is to enclose the contactor inside an {\it explosion-proof} housing.

Another solution is to immerse the contacts in an insulating oil bath.

\vskip 10pt

Another solution is to purge the contactor's enclosure with clean air or an inert gas.
