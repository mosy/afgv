The fraction of radio wave energy reflected off a liquid surface after traveling through the air may be calculated by the following equation:

$$R = {(\sqrt{\epsilon} - 1)^2 \over (\sqrt{\epsilon} + 1)^2}$$

\noindent
Where,

$R$ = Reflection ratio (a number between 0 and 1)

$\epsilon$ = Dielectric permittivity of the liquid relative to a vacuum ($\epsilon_{air} \approx 1$)

Manipulate this equation to solve for $\epsilon$ if the value of $R$ is known.

In order to solve for $\epsilon$, we need to unpack it from the square-roots and squared terms, to get it all by itself.  One strategy that might occur to someone is to carry out the binomial squares (i.e. multiply out $\sqrt{\epsilon} - 1$ times itself in the numerator, and $\sqrt{\epsilon} + 1$ times itself in the denominator).  Unfortunately, though, that leads to both $\epsilon$ and $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ terms lying about that are difficult to collect together again for a solution.

A different approach is to eliminate the square terms by square-rooting both sides.  Here is a step-by-step solution showing how to do it:

$$R = {(\sqrt{\epsilon} - 1)^2 \over (\sqrt{\epsilon} + 1)^2}$$

$$R (\sqrt{\epsilon} + 1)^2 = (\sqrt{\epsilon} - 1)^2$$

$$\sqrt{R (\sqrt{\epsilon} + 1)^2} = \sqrt{(\sqrt{\epsilon} - 1)^2}$$

$$\sqrt{R} (\sqrt{\epsilon} + 1) = \sqrt{\epsilon} - 1$$

$$\sqrt{R} \sqrt{\epsilon} + \sqrt{R} = \sqrt{\epsilon} - 1$$

$$\sqrt{R} \sqrt{\epsilon} - \sqrt{\epsilon} = - \sqrt{R} - 1$$

$$\sqrt{\epsilon} (\sqrt{R} - 1) = - \sqrt{R} - 1$$

$$\sqrt{\epsilon} =  {- \sqrt{R} - 1 \over \sqrt{R} - 1}$$

Solution:

$$\epsilon = {(-\sqrt{R} - 1)^2 \over (\sqrt{R} - 1)^2}$$
