Calculate the RF power intercepted by a receiving antenna from a 350 kHz radio transmitter located 14 miles away, assuming no obstacles or other interference between the transmitter and receiver.  Use the following parameters in your calculations:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Frequency = 350 kHz
\item{} Distance = 14 miles
\item{} Transmitter output power = 15 watts
\item{} Transmitter antenna gain = 3 dBi
\item{} Receiver antenna gain = 8.7 dBi
\item{} Transmitter cable loss = 0.11 dB per foot ; 72 feet long
\end{itemize}

Explain why we did not need to include the loss of the receiver cable in this problem.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$P_{rx}$ = $-4.8438$ dBm = 327.8 microwatts

\vskip 10pt

The receiver cable is irrelevant because we were only asked to calculate the amount of power intercepted by the receiving antenna, not the amount of power that antenna actually delivers to the receiver unit.
