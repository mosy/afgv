Suppose a Rosemount model 3095MV FOUNDATION Fieldbus transmitter is executing an analog input (AI) function block with the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\tt Channel} = 1
\item{} {\tt L\_type} = Indirect
\item{} {\tt XD\_Scale} = 20 to 150 inches H$_{2}$O
\item{} {\tt OUT\_Scale} = 0 to 375 gallons
\end{itemize}

Calculate the following AI function block values when this transmitter senses a differential pressure of 109.2 inches H$_{2}$O:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\tt FIELD\_VAL} = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} {\tt PV} signal output by AI block = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} 
\end{itemize}

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What would the new values be if the {\tt L\_Type} parameter were set to {\it direct} instead of {\it indirect}?
\item{} What would the new values be if the {\tt L\_Type} parameter were set to {\it indirect square root} instead of {\it indirect}?
\item{} What would this transmitter be sensing if the {\tt Channel} parameter had a value of 2 instead of 1?
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\tt FIELD\_VAL} = \underbar{\bf 68.615 \%}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} {\tt PV} signal output by AI block = \underbar{\bf 257.3 gallons} 
\end{itemize}

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be noted that the 3095MV transmitter has five channels available to AI blocks:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Channel \#1 = Differential pressure
\item{} Channel \#2 = Static pressure
\item{} Channel \#3 = Process temperature
\item{} Channel \#4 = Sensor temperature
\item{} Channel \#5 = Mass flow
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Calculation of the {\tt FIELD\_VAL} parameter is described in Rosemount's {\it Foundation Fieldbus Blocks} product manual, derived from the sensor's raw value on a range defined by the {\tt XD\_Scale} range points.  Thus:

$${{109.2 - 20} \over {150 - 20}} = 0.68615 = 68.615 \%$$

\vskip 10pt

The PV signal output by the AI block, of course, will be scaled because we have specified the {\tt L\_Type} to be ``indirect'':

$$(0.68615)(375) = 257.31 \hbox{ gallons}$$

\vskip 10pt

If the {\tt L\_Type} was set for ``direct'', the PV signal output by the block would be identical to the {\tt FIELD\_VAL} in percent.

\vskip 10pt

If the {\tt L\_Type} was set for ``indirect square root'', the PV signal output by the block would be:

$$\left(\sqrt{0.68615} \right) (375) = (0.82834)(375) = 310.63 \hbox{ gallons}$$
