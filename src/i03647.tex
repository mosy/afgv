A FOUNDATION Fieldbus pressure transmitter is used to sense hydraulic fluid pressure applied to a cylinder with a piston diameter of 3 inches.  Recall that the force/pressure/area formula is $F = PA$.

\vskip 10pt

Determine the proper {\tt XD\_Scale}, {\tt OUT\_Scale}, and {\tt L\_Type} parameter values to make the transmitter report the cylinder's {\it force} over a range of pressure 0 to 2000 PSI.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\tt L\_Type} = Indirect

\vskip 10pt

{\tt XD\_Scale} = 0 to 2000 PSI

\vskip 10pt

{\tt OUT\_Scale} = 0 to 14,137.2 pounds
