A FOUNDATION Fieldbus transmitter senses pressure inside a process vessel, through a liquid-filled capillary tube.  The height difference between the vessel connection point and the transmitter introduces an additional pressure at the transmitter's sensing port of +1.7 PSI due to the weight of the fill fluid.  The operators need to see the vessel's pressure displayed over a range of 25 to 130 PSI.  Determine the proper {\tt L\_type}, {\tt XD\_Scale}, and {\tt OUT\_Scale} values to enter into this transmitter's Analog Input function block when configuring the system:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\tt L\_type} = Indirect
\item{} {\tt XD\_Scale} = 26.7 to 131.7 PSI 
\item{} {\tt OUT\_Scale} = 25 to 130 PSI
\end{itemize}
