A newly constructed PLC-controlled motor starter system refuses to work -- the motor shaft does not turn after the operator presses the ``Start'' switch and waits.  After this, you measure 116 volts AC between the PLC power supply's L1 terminal and the terminal labeled ``E'' on the thermal overload.  A laptop PC shows the PLC program as it exists in memory, but without any colored status highlighting:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03658x01.eps}$$

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault in this system.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.
