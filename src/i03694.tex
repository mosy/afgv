This distillation tower separates a mixed ``feed'' liquid into two different products called ``distillate'' and ``bottoms'', using liquid level control loops on the top and on the bottom.  The top level control system maintains a constant level of condensed ``distillate'' liquid in the accumulator vessel, while the bottom level control system maintains a constant level of ``bottoms'' liquid in the reboiler vessel:

Suppose an instrument technician mis-calibrates the accumulator level transmitter so that it outputs more signal than it should (representing more liquid level than is actually there).  What effect will this have on the actual liquid level inside the accumulator?  Will the actual liquid level become {\it less} than it should be, {\it more} than it should be, or will it remain exactly {\it as} it should be?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The actual accumulator liquid level will be {\bf less} than it should be as a result of the fault.
