Microbes (bacteria) involved with the digestion of organic waste must form the material necessary to multiply their numbers from compounds available to them.  Assuming a formulation of C$_{5}$H$_{7}$O$_{2}$N for microbial cell matter, show how this compound may be formed from carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia:

$$\hbox{CO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{NH}_3 \to \hbox{C}_5 \hbox{H}_7 \hbox{O}_2 \hbox{N} + \hbox{O}_2$$

In other words, {\it balance} this equation to show proper proportions of all compounds.  Also, elaborate on whether you think this reaction is {\it exothermic} or {\it endothermic}.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$5\hbox{CO}_2 + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + \hbox{NH}_3 \to \hbox{C}_5 \hbox{H}_7 \hbox{O}_2 \hbox{N} + 5\hbox{O}_2$$

This is definitely an {\it endothermic} reaction, because both CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O are highly stable (i.e. low-energy) molecules requiring much energy input to split apart, which is what must happen in order to form the compound necessary to build microbes.
