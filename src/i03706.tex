Balance each of the two following chemical reactions, depicting the {\it incomplete} combustion of methane gas with oxygen:

$$2\hbox{CH}_4 + 3\hbox{O}_2 \to \hbox{CO} + \hbox{CO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$

\vskip 10pt

$$4\hbox{CH}_4 + 7\hbox{O}_2 \to \hbox{CO} + \hbox{CO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
Note that the first equation was a bit of a trick: there are {\it no} molecules of CO$_{2}$ produced at this ratio of methane to oxygen!

$$2\hbox{CH}_4 + 3\hbox{O}_2 \to 2\hbox{CO} + 4\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
In the second reaction, we have both CO and CO$_{2}$ produced, along with water vapor:

$$4\hbox{CH}_4 + 7\hbox{O}_2 \to 2\hbox{CO} + 2\hbox{CO}_2 + 8\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}$$
