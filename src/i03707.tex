\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} As always, the most important point to discuss in questions such as this is {\it why}.  Discuss the rationale for selecting each analyzer type for the given applications, and any caveats associated with those selections.
\item{} Write a one-sentence explanation for each of these analyzer types, explaining how each one functions.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Flame ionization (G) is a ``maybe'' technology for measuring fuel heating value because the scenario given does not provide enough information to know if heating value (BTU/ft$^{3}$) scales linearly with carbon count.
