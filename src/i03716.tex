{\bf Programming Challenge -- Engine auto-start sequence with cranking time limit}

\vskip 10pt

Suppose we wish to have a PLC start up an engine automatically on demand.  We need the PLC to follow this sequence in starting the engine:

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

$$\vbox{\offinterlineskip
\halign{\strut
\vrule \quad\hfil # \ \hfil & 
\vrule \quad\hfil # \ \hfil & 
\vrule \quad\hfil # \ \hfil & 
\vrule \quad\hfil # \ \hfil & 
\vrule \quad\hfil # \ \hfil \vrule \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% First row
Step \# & Throttle (idle/run) & Choke & Ignition & Starter \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% Another row
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% Another row

%
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% Another row
3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% Another row
4 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
} % End of \halign 
}$$ % End of \vbox

The program needs to have two discrete inputs and four discrete outputs:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Input\_start: Start-up command signal (0 = shut down ; 1 = begin start-up sequence)
\item{} Input\_run\_detector: Running sensor (0 = not firing ; 1 = engine running)
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Output\_throttle: (0 = idle position; 1 = run position)
\item{} Output\_choke: (0 = off (run position) ; 1 = choked position)
\item{} Output\_ignition: (0 = off ; 1 = on)
\item{} Output\_starter: (0 = off ; 1 = cranking)
\end{itemize}

Steps 1 through 3 should happen according to a timed schedule, but the transition from step 3 (cranking the engine) to step 4 (engine running) should occur {\it only} if Input\_1 shows the engine has fired.  The sequence should immediately revert to step 1 if the ``Input\_start'' command signal ever turns off.  

Furthermore, the sequence should abort if step 3 has been active for more than 10 seconds without the engine firing.  After aborting the sequence (i.e. re-setting back to step 1 and remaining there), an alarm bit should be set by the PLC program to notify an operator that the engine did not start as it was supposed to.


\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} How will your sequencer ``know'' when to advance from one step to the next, especially given the change of criteria from steps 1 through 3, to step 4?
\item{} How will the program determine if the engine has been cranking for more than 10 seconds continuously?
\item{} How will the sequencing function be re-set back to step 1, and remain there rather than progress through the start-up sequence again if the sequence was aborted due to the engine not firing after 10 seconds of cranking (i.e. the command signal is still ``1'')?
\end{itemize}
