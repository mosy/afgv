The so-called {\it Claus process} is widely used to convert hydrogen sulfide gas (H$_{2}$S) into elemental sulfur (S), turning a waste product of oil refining into a valuable feedstock for chemical processes.  The conversion takes place in two steps, shown by these (unbalanced) chemical reactions:

$$\hbox{H}_2\hbox{S} + \hbox{O}_2 \rightarrow \hbox{SO}_2 + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \hskip 30pt \Delta H = -518.8 \hbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}$$

$$\hbox{H}_2\hbox{S} + \hbox{SO}_2 \rightarrow \hbox{S} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \hskip 35pt \Delta H = -142.8 \hbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}$$

\vskip 10pt

A simplified PFD of the Claus process appears here:

Determine the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Where each of the two chemical reactions occurs in the PFD.
\item{} The meaning of the $\Delta H$ values stated next to each equation.
\item{} Which of the two heat exchangers transfers more heat energy than the other.
\item{} The principal danger of H$_{2}$S gas as it relates to human health.
\item{} The probable types and locations of analytical transmitters in this process, and how their measurements might be used for control.
\item{} Potential pollutants emitted by this process into the atmosphere.
\end{itemize}

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify suitable flowmeter technologies for each of the process flows shown in this PFD.  Note that molten sulfur is hot (about 240 $^{o}$F), viscous, and solidifies quickly when cooled to ambient temperature.
\item{} Identify pipes carrying fluids into and out of various vessels in this process, and identify whether the temperature of the incoming or outgoing flow will be greater.  Explain why, in each case.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Where each of the two chemical reactions occurs in the PFD.  {\it Both reactions take place in the acid gas furnace, and in the reheaters.  The second reaction mostly occurs in the two converter vessels.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The meaning of the $\Delta H$ values stated next to each equation. {\it The negative value means both reactions are exothermic, the first releasing much more heat than the second.  Another clue to the exothermic nature of these reactions is the presence of cooling water heat exchangers after every reactor.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Which of the two heat exchangers transfers more heat energy than the other.  {\it The first heat exchanger (after the acid gas furnace) because it handles most of the first reaction than the others, which is the most exothermic.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The principal danger of H$_{2}$S gas as it relates to human health.  {\it Hydrogen sulfide paralyzes the nervous system in low concentrations.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The probable types and locations of analytical transmitters in this process, and how their measurements might be used for control.  {\it Definitely SO$_{2}$ analyzers following the converters, to indicate how thorough the second reaction proceeded.  Possibly also H$_{2}$S analyzers as well to secondarily indicate reaction completeness.  Ambient air H$_{2}$S analyzers scattered throughout the unit for personnel safety.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Potential pollutants emitted by this process into the atmosphere.  {\it Unreacted H$_{2}$S and SO$_{2}$.}
