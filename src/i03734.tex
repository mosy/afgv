Suppose you measured the output of a type J thermocouple inserted into a process vessel and read 12.53 millivolts on your digital multimeter.  Knowing the ambient temperature at the connection point (using a portable thermometer) is 54 degrees Fahrenheit, how hot is the tip of the thermocouple inside the process vessel?

Suppose you measured the output of a type E thermocouple inserted into a process pipe and read 23.85 millivolts on your digital multimeter.  Knowing the ambient temperature at the connection point (using a portable thermometer) is 33 degrees Celsius, how hot is the tip of the thermocouple inside the pipe?
