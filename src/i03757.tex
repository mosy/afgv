Read the ``General Tool and Supply List'' page of your worksheet (near the beginning) and answer the following questions:

\vskip 10pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify the tools you do not presently own.
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Where might you be able to purchase tools at discount prices?
\vskip 10pt
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Also, read the ``Required Student Supplies and Materials'' section for the next course (INST231 -- PLC Programming) and discuss the small PLC and HMI panel hardware you will be required to purchase for this next course.  These purchases usually take at least a week to ship, and so you need to order them {\it now} in order to have sufficient time for them to arrive.
