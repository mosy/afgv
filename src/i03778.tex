How much force will be required to compress a spring (from its relaxed state) a displacement of 3 inches, given a spring constant of 150 pounds per inch?  How much energy (in foot-pounds) will be stored in the spring after compressing it this much?

\vskip 10pt

Write a mathematical expression (using proper calculus notation) representing the energy invested in this spring by compressing it by 3 inches.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

450 pounds of force will be required to compress this spring 3 inches ($F = kx$).  After being compressed this much, the spring will be storing 675 inch-pounds of energy, which is equal to 56.25 foot-pounds.

$$E = \int_0^3 150x \> dx$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$$E_p = {1 \over 2}kx^2$$
