How much air pressure will be required to compress this valve actuator spring three-quarters of an inch, assuming it begins in a relaxed state with no air pressure applied?  Assume a $k$ value for the spring of 1340 lb/in, and a diaphragm diameter of 14 inches.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The necessary compression force is 1005 pounds (1340 lb/in $\times$ 0.75 in).  With a diaphragm area of 153.9 square inches, this yields a pressure of 6.53 pounds per square inch.
