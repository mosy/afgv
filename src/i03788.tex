An Allen-Bradley Logix5000 PLC control system uses a model 1756-IF6CIS analog input card to convert 4-20 mA transmitter signals into digital numbers used in the control program.  This analog input card has an analog signal range of 0 to 21.09376 milliamps and a corresponding count range of -32768 to +32767 counts.

\vskip 10pt

Suppose you see that the count value registered in this PLC for pressure transmitter PT-63 is +2843 counts.  This transmitter has a calibrated range of 40 to 280 PSI (input) and 4 to 20 mA (output).  Determine the pressure sensed by this transmitter, as well as the magnitude of its analog current signal input to the PLC:

\vskip 10pt

Pressure = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} PSI

\vskip 10pt

Current = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} mA

\underbar{file i03788}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Pressure = \underbar{\bf 151.932} PSI

\vskip 5pt

Current = \underbar{\bf 11.462} mA
