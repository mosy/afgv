Resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected in parallel by virtue of being attached to the same two terminals on the terminal strip.  Draw connecting wires that will create a {\it series} circuit between the parallel $R_1$/$R_2$ pair and the lone resistor $R_3$, such that voltage will drop across each resistor in the polarity shown by the (+) and ($-$) symbols:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Supposing the battery has a voltage of 11 volts, and all resistors are 1 k$\Omega$ in resistance value, calculate the voltage dropped by each resistor.
\item{} Supposing the battery has a voltage of 11 volts, and all resistors are 1 k$\Omega$ in resistance value, calculate the current passing through each resistor as well as the current passing through the battery.
\end{itemize}

Bear in mind that this is not the {\it only} possible circuit solution:

Challenge yourself by designing a different circuit to meet the same criteria!
