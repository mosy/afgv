Draw connecting wires that will create a {\it parallel} circuit between all three resistors, such that current (conventional flow notation) will go through each resistor as shown by the arrows:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Supposing the battery has a voltage of 14 volts, and all resistors are 1 k$\Omega$ in resistance value, calculate the voltage dropped by each resistor.
\item{} Supposing the battery has a voltage of 14 volts, and all resistors are 1 k$\Omega$ in resistance value, calculate the current passing through each resistor as well as the current passing through the battery.
\end{itemize}
