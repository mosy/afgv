Draw connecting wires that will create a {\it parallel} circuit, such that voltage will drop across each resistor in the polarity shown by the (+) and ($-$) symbols:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Supposing the battery has a voltage of 2 volts, and all resistors are 1 k$\Omega$ in resistance value, calculate the voltage dropped by each resistor.
\item{} Supposing the battery has a voltage of 2 volts, and all resistors are 1 k$\Omega$ in resistance value, calculate the current passing through each resistor as well as the current passing through the battery.
\end{itemize}

Bear in mind that this is not the {\it only} possible circuit solution:

Challenge yourself by designing a different circuit to meet the same criteria!
