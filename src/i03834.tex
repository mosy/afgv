The Emerson ``Remote Operations Controller'' (ROC) model 809 is a device very similar to a PLC.  Its standard discrete input module is shown in the diagram below, with the internal circuitry for channel 1 shown (typical of the other seven discrete input channels on this module):

Sketch connecting wires such that the three pushbutton switches (A, B, and C) connect to input channels IN3, IN6, and IN8, respectively.

Also, identify whether this input module {\it sources} or {\it sinks} current.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Bear in mind that this is not the {\it only} possible circuit solution:
