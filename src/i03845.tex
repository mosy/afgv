This all-pneumatic boiler control system works to regulate the level of water inside the steam drum:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03845x01.eps}$$

One day the boilerhouse engineer asks you to help him raise the water level inside the steam drum as the boiler is operating.  The water level normally holds at 50\%, but he wants to raise the level to 65\% to perform a test on a high-level water alarm switch recently installed on the drum.  The only problem is, the setpoint on the LIC is non-adjustable, so there is no way to raise the drum level setpoint from 50\% to 65\%.  Neither the LIC nor the FIC has a manual mode.

\vskip 10pt

Devise a way to ``trick'' the control system into raising the water drum level for an indefinite amount of time needed to perform the engineer's test, given the fact that all these instruments are pneumatic (mechanical), which means their measurement ranges may be adjusted during live operation using nothing but a screwdriver.  Be specific in your description of the solution, and explain why it will work.

{\it Award half-credit for solutions that would only \underbar{temporarily} raise the steam drum's water level.}

\vskip 10pt

The level transmitter (LT) must be re-calibrated to register {\it 15\% less} level than is actually in the drum, so that the level controller (LIC) works to raise the drum's water level (to get the LT's signal back to 50\% when the real water level is 65\%).
