Examine this ladder logic program for an Allen-Bradley MicroLogix PLC controlling a motor, with multiple ``Start,'' ``Stop,'' and safety pull-switch shutdowns:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03854x01.eps}$$

Based on this program, determine the necessary type of hard-wired switch contact for each input switch:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\tt START\_SWITCH\_LOCAL}: {\it normally-open} (NO) or {\it normally-closed} (NC)?
\vskip 5pt
\item{} {\tt START\_SWITCH\_REMOTE}: {\it normally-open} (NO) or {\it normally-closed} (NC)?
\vskip 5pt
\item{} {\tt STOP\_SWITCH\_LOCAL}: {\it normally-open} (NO) or {\it normally-closed} (NC)?
\vskip 5pt
\item{} {\tt PULL\_SWITCH\_1}: {\it normally-open} (NO) or {\it normally-closed} (NC)?
\vskip 5pt
\item{} {\tt PULL\_SWITCH\_2}: {\it normally-open} (NO) or {\it normally-closed} (NC)?
\end{itemize}

Also, identify at least two different faults independently capable of preventing the motor from starting up despite attempts actuating the local start switch {\it and} actuating the remote start switch:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This happens to be one of those unusual cases where the type of real-world switch contact exactly matches its virtual switch contact instruction inside the PLC in every case.  Since this program uses retentive coil instructions (``Latch'' and ``Unlatch'') which require virtual power in order to take action, we desire each of these switches to send virtual power to the respective coil when actuated.  When one of the normally-open (NO) switches is actuated, it sends real power to the PLC input channel, setting the input register bit (1), causing the NO contact instruction to close and send virtual power to the coil.  When one of the normally-closed (NC) switches is actuated, it halts real power from getting to the PLC input, clearing the input register bit (0), causing the NC contact instruction to close and send virtual power to the coil.  Therefore:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\tt START\_SWITCH\_LOCAL}: {\bf normally-open} (NO)
\item{} {\tt START\_SWITCH\_REMOTE}: {\bf normally-open} (NO)
\item{} {\tt STOP\_SWITCH\_LOCAL}: {\bf normally-closed} (NC)
\item{} {\tt PULL\_SWITCH\_1}: {\bf normally-closed} (NC)
\item{} {\tt PULL\_SWITCH\_2}: {\bf normally-open} (NO)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Some possible faults causing motor to not start from either start switch:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Open fault in local start switch wiring
\item{} Open fault in remote start switch wiring
\item{} Open fault in local stop switch wiring
\item{} Open fault in pull switch \#1 wiring
\item{} Shorted fault (sending power to PLC input at all times) in pull switch \#2 wiring
\item{} Open fault in motor contactor circuit
\item{} PLC program execution halted (e.g. not in Run mode)
\end{itemize}
