An interesting way to achieve reduced-voltage starting for a three-phase motor is to use a {\it 6-lead} motor where the three stator winding sets are individually wired so as to allow either wye (start) or delta configurations:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03870x01.eps}$$

A ``Start'' contactor sends power to the stator windings in a wye configuration for a short start-up time (perhaps 10 seconds), then that starter disengages and a ``Run'' starter energizes to send power to the stator windings in a delta configuration.  In the ``wye'' configuration, each winding receives $1 \over \sqrt{3}$ of the line voltage.  In the ``delta'' configuration, each winding receives the full line voltage.

Sketch the proper wire connections to create just such a ``wye-delta'' motor starter.  Hint: terminals 1, 2, and 3 of the motor {\it always} connect to the three-phase power lines!
