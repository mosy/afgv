Read and outline the ``Water Traps and Pigtail Siphons'' subsection of the ``Pressure Sensor Accessories'' section of the ``Continuous Pressure Measurement'' chapter in your {\it Lessons In Industrial Instrumentation} textbook.  Note the page numbers where important illustrations, photographs, equations, tables, and other relevant details are found.  Prepare to thoughtfully discuss with your instructor and classmates the concepts and examples explored in this reading.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In steam processes, pressure-sensing instruments may be protected from the high temperature of the steam by isolation through water traps.  A low spot in the impulse tubing, or a loop called a {\it pigtail siphon}, will trap condensed water and form a seal preventing high-temperature steam from reaching the instrument.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Might there be any process fluids other than {\it steam} worthy of using a pigtail siphon on?

{\bf Prep Quiz:}

The purpose of a {\it pigtail siphon} is to:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Protects personnel from accidental contact with process fluid
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Facilitates maintenance and calibration of the transmitter
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Ensures superior calibration stability over time
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Prevents the transmitter from being harmed by over-pressure events
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Dampens pressure pulsations for more steady measurements
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Prevents the transmitter from being harmed by hot vapors
\end{itemize}
