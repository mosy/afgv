Determine what type of temperature sensor is shown in this pictorial diagram, and then sketch wires showing how to correctly connect the sensor to the temperature transmitter:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03998x01.eps}$$

Note what types of metal each of the connecting wires should be (e.g. copper, chromel, alumel, constantan, iron, platinum, etc.).

\begin{itemize}
\item{} A problem-solving technique useful for making proper connections in pictorial circuit diagrams is to first identify the directions of all DC currents entering and exiting component terminals, as well as the respective voltage polarity marks (+,$-$) for those terminals, based on your knowledge of each component acting either as an electrical {\it source} or an electrical {\it load}.  Discuss and compare how these arrows and polarity marks simplify the task of properly connecting wires between components. 
\item{} Explain why you used thermocouple-metal wires where you did, and why you used copper wires where you did.
\item{} Suppose all labels and wire colors on the thermocouple were rubbed off, so you could not even tell what kind of sensor it was: thermocouple, RTD, or thermistor.  Devise a simple test by which you could ascertain the identify of the temperature sensor.
\end{itemize}

Note: other possibilities for wiring the 4-20 mA ``loop'' circuit exist, but the direction of current needs to be the same as for this circuit.  No alternative wiring schemes exist for the thermocouple, though, except the option of using {\it extension-grade} wire instead of {\it thermocouple-grade} wire.
