The reference manual for the Rosemount model 3144 temperature transmitter states that the default (factory) configuration for this transmitter is for the {\it failure mode} to be ``high''.  Explain what this means, and why the ``failure mode'' is an important parameter for a thermocouple instrument.

\vskip 10pt

Also, comment on the ``NAMUR'' signal levels differentiating a saturated condition from a detected failure, and why this standard might be important in a control system.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Are NAMUR signals used only for temperature instruments, or for other types of instruments as well (e.g. pressure, level, flow)?
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Hint: what Rosemount refers to as a ``failure mode'' encompasses the more specific concept of ``burnout''.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This switch setting configures the transmitter to default either to a high-current value (over 20 mA) or to a low-current value (below 4 mA) in the event of certain self-diagnosed errors, including a burnt-open thermocouple.

The NAMUR standard signal levels for representing abnormal status of a 4-20 mA electronic transmitter are as follows (from table 2-1 on page 2-5 of the manual):

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.
