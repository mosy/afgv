%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Turbine flowmeters use a free-spinning ``windmill'' placed in the fluid flow to measure that fluid's velocity.

\vskip 10pt

The von K\'arm\'an effect is the alternating series of vortices formed when a fluid moves past a blunt obstacle.  The frequency of this vortex shedding is the basis of a vortex flowmeter: the higher the fluid's velocity, the faster the oscillation ensues.

\vskip 10pt

Magnetic flowmters exploit the electrical conductivity of the process liquid to generate a small voltage based on fluid velocity.  The fluid moves through a magnetic field, generating an EMF perpendicular to both the field and the direction of flow.

\vskip 10pt

Ultrasonic flowmeters measure fluid velocity by passing high-frequency sound waves through the fluid path.  ``Doppler'' flowmeters bounce sound waves off of bubbles or solids in the liquid stream, inferring velocity from the pitch of the echo.  ``Transit time'' flowmeters send a sound wave upstream and downstream, comparing the times of flight for each pulse.  The difference in time indicates fluid velocity.

\vskip 10pt

Optical flowmeters measure fluid velocity by passing light through the moving fluid and monitoring the effects that fluid has on the light's passage.  In an ``L2F'' (laser-two-focus) optical flowmeter, the sequential interruption of a two light beams by any moving particles in the fluid is used to time the motion of those particles and thereby infer fluid velocity.  In a ``scintillation'' optical flowmeter, turbulence within the clear fluid warps the light beam (the same effect that makes stars appear to ``twinkle'' when viewed from the surface of the Earth), and the sequential detection of common scintillation patterns by a pair of optical sensors is used to time the motion of the fluid and thereby infer fluid velocity.
