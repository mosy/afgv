En spesiell type strømningsmåler er \textit{Corilis}-strømningsmåler. Forklar så godt du kan hvordan denne type strømningsmåler virker. 
%One of the stranger flow-measurement technologies is the {\it Coriolis} flowmeter.  Do your best to explain how this type of flowmeter functions.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Coriolis flowmeters pass liquid through a flexible, vibrating tube.  The resonant frequency of this vibrating tube varies with fluid density, while the inertia of the flowing fluid causes the tube to undulate (induces a phase shift).  By sensing the resonant frequency of the tubes' vibrations, the instrument infers fluid density.  By sensing the phase shift between one portion of the tube versus another, the instrument infers mass flow rate.
