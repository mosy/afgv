A horizontal venturi tube at a seawater desalinization plant is sized to produce 37.25 kPa while flowing at 1400 m³/h of sea water (at a density of 1.025 grams per cubic centimeter).

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the differential pressure produced by this same venturi tube at a flow rate of 740 m³/h, and at a lighter density of 1.01 g/cm$^{3}$.

\vskip 10pt

Assuming a water density of 1.03 g/cm$^{3}$ and a measured differential pressure of 3.1 PSID, calculate the volumetric flow rate through the venturi tube.

\vskip 10pt

Assuming a water density of 1.02 g/cm$^{3}$ and a measured differential pressure of 12 kPaD, calculate the volumetric flow rate through the venturi tube.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Partial answer:}

\vskip 10pt

$\Delta P$ = 10.25 kPa at 740 m³/h and 1.01 g/cm³

\vskip 10pt
$Q$ = 1058 m³/h flow rate at 3.1 PSID and 1.03 g/cm$^{3}$

\vskip 10pt

$Q$ = 796.6 m³/h flow rate at 12 kPaD and 1.02 g/cm$^{3}$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$$Q = 1831.5 \sqrt{\Delta P \over \rho}$$

\vskip 10pt

$P$ = 5.438 "Hg at 4250 GPM and 1.01 g/cm$^{3}$ density

\vskip 10pt

$Q$ = 4,533.9 GPM flow rate at 3.1 PSID and 1.03 g/cm$^{3}$

\vskip 10pt

$Q$ = 3,413.7 GPM flow rate at 12 kPaD and 1.02 g/cm$^{3}$
