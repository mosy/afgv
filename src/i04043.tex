A horizontal venturi tube at a seawater desalinization plant is sized to produce 37.25 kPa while flowing at 1400 m³/h of sea water (at a density of 1.025 grams per cubic centimeter).

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the differential pressure produced by this same venturi tube at a flow rate of 740 m³/h, and at a lighter density of 1.01 g/cm$^{3}$.

\vskip 10pt

%Assuming a water density of 1.03 g/cm$^{3}$ and a measured differential pressure of 3.1 PSID, calculate the volumetric flow rate through the venturi tube.

%\vskip 10pt

Assuming a water density of 1.02 g/cm$^{3}$ and a measured differential pressure of 12 kPaD, calculate the volumetric flow rate through the venturi tube.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Partial answer:}

\vskip 10pt

$\Delta P$ = 10.25 kPa at 740 m³/h and 1.01 g/cm³


\vskip 10pt

$Q$ = 796.6 m³/h flow rate at 12 kPaD and 1.02 g/cm$^{3}$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)
$$k=\frac{Q}{\sqrt{\frac{\Delta P}{\rho}}}=\frac{1400}{\sqrt{\frac{37.25}{1.025}}}$$
$$\Delta P=\left(\frac{Q}{k}\right)^2\cdot \rho=\left(\frac{740}{232.23}\right)^2\cdot 1.01=10.25kPa$$
$$Q=k\sqrt{\Delta P}{\rho}=232.23\sqrt{12}{1.02}=796.6 m^3/h$$
