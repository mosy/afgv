An orifice plate measuring mass flowrate of 300 PSIG saturated steam ($\rho$ = 0.68 lbm/ft$^{3}$) develops a differential pressure of 100 inches water column at a flow rate of 120 pounds per minute.  Calculate the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Differential pressure at 60 lbm/min mass flow = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Differential pressure at 77 lbm/min mass flow and $\rho$ = 0.69 lbm/ft$^{3}$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Mass flow rate at 90 "W.C. = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Mass flow rate at 43 "W.C. and $\rho$ = 0.70 lbm/ft$^{3}$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Differential pressure at 60 lbm/min mass flow = {\bf 25 "W.C. }
\item{} Differential pressure at 77 lbm/min mass flow and $\rho$ = 0.69 lbm/ft$^{3}$ = {\bf 40.58 "W.C.}
\item{} Mass flow rate at 90 "W.C. = {\bf 113.84 lbm/min}
\item{} Mass flow rate at 43 "W.C. and $\rho$ = 0.70 lbm/ft$^{3}$ = {\bf 79.84 lbm/min}
\end{itemize}
