Transit-time (``counterpropagation'') ultrasonic flowmeters infer the flow rate of a gas or a liquid by measuring the time it takes for sound waves to travel both upstream and downstream through a moving fluid:

$$Q = k {t_{up} - t_{down} \over (t_{up})(t_{down})}$$

\noindent
Where,

$Q$ = Volumetric flow rate

$k$ = Constant of proportionality

$t_{up}$ = Time for sound pulse to travel upstream (against the flow)

$t_{down}$ = Time for sound pulse to travel downstream (with the flow)

\vskip 10pt

Perform a ``thought experiment'' where the fluid inside an ultrasonic flowmeter is standing still, and demonstrate how this equation gives a value of zero for $Q$.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} A strong emphasis is placed on performing ``thought experiments'' in this course.  Explain why this is.  What practical benefits might students realize from regular mental exercises such as this?
\item{} Perform a thought experiment demonstrating how the speed of sound is irrelevant for this type of flowmeter, based on an analysis of the formula shown above.  Use the substitutions $t_{up} = {L \over {c-v}}$ and $t_{down} = {L \over {c+v}}$ to define travel time in terms of path length ($L$), fluid velocity ($v$), and speed of sound ($c$).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If the fluid is not moving, $t_{up} = t_{down}$.  This makes the numerator of the fraction equal to zero, resulting in a $Q$ of zero.

Mathematical proof that $c$ is irrelevant to the measurement of flow rate by transit times:

$$Q = k {t_{up} - t_{down} \over (t_{up})(t_{down})}$$

$$Q = k {{L \over c-v} - {L \over c+v} \over \left({L \over c+v}\right)  \left({L \over c-v}\right)}$$

$$Q = k {{L (c + v) \over c^2 - v^2} - {L (c - v) \over c^2 - v^2} \over {L^2 \over c^2 - v^2}}$$

$$Q = k {{L (c + v) - L (c - v) \over c^2 - v^2} \over {L^2 \over c^2 - v^2}}$$

$$Q = k \left({L (c + v) - L (c - v) \over c^2 - v^2}\right) \left({c^2 - v^2 \over L^2}\right) $$

$$Q = k {L (c + v) - L (c - v) \over L^2}$$

$$Q = k {Lc + Lv - Lc + Lv \over L^2}$$

$$Q = k {Lv + Lv \over L^2}$$

$$Q = k {2Lv \over L^2}$$

$$Q = k {2v \over L}$$

$$Q = {2kv \over L}$$
