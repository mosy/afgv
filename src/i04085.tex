A municipal wastewater treatment plant uses a 6-foot-wide Parshall flume to measure the flow of effluent (treated water leaving the facility, also called ``outfall'').  Calculate the head (height of water) immediately upstream of this flume at an effluent flow rate of 5,460 GPM.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Why do you think a flume is a good candidate technology for measuring the flow rate of wastewater?
\item{} How did you need to apply {\it algebra} to solve for the height of water in this flume?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$H$ = 7.697 inches

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

$$Q = 4 L H^{1.53} \hbox{\hskip 20pt 1-foot to 8-foot wide throat Parshall flume}$$

\noindent
Where,

$Q$ = Volumetric flow rate (cubic feet per second -- CFS)

$L$ = Width of flume throat (feet)

$H$ = Head (feet)

\vskip 10pt

First, converting the given flow rate from units of GPM to units of cubic feet per second:

$$\left(5460 \hbox{ gal} \over \hbox{min}\right) \left(1 \hbox{ min} \over 60 \hbox{ sec}\right) \left(231 \hbox{ in}^3 \over 1 \hbox{ gal}\right) \left(1 \hbox{ ft}^3 \over 1728 \hbox{ in}^3\right) = 12.165 \hbox{ CFS}$$

\vskip 10pt

Now, manipulating the formula to solve for $H$:

$$Q = 4 L H^{1.53}$$

$${Q \over {4 L}} = H^{1.53}$$

$$H = \left({Q \over {4 L}}\right)^{1 \over 1.53}$$

$$H = \left({Q \over {4 L}}\right)^{1 \over 1.53}$$

$$H = \left({12.165 \over {(4) (6)}}\right)^{1 \over 1.53}$$

$$H = 0.6414 \hbox{ ft} = 7.697 \hbox{ in}$$
