An industrial cooling tower uses a vortex flowmeter to measure the flow rate of water through an 8-inch pipe (bore size = 7.981 inches).  Calculate the {\it minimum} water flow rate measurable by this flowmeter, assuming a minimum necessary Reynolds number value of 20,000.

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Why do vortex flowmeters suffer from {\it low-flow cutoff}?
\item{} Supposing we needed better low-flow measurement capability in this cooling water flow measurement application than what this flowmeter can deliver, what alternative(s) do you suggest?  Keep in mind that we need to minimize cost while making our choices!
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\hbox{Re} = {{(3160) G_f Q} \over {D \mu}}$$

\noindent
Where,

Re = Reynolds number (unitless)

$G_f$ = Specific gravity of liquid (unitless)

$Q$ = Flow rate (gallons per minute)

$D$ = Diameter of pipe (inches)

$\mu$ = Absolute viscosity of fluid (centipoise)

3160 = Conversion factor for British units

\vskip 10pt

Since the process fluid in question here is {\it water}, we know that both $G_f$ and $\mu$ are equal to 1:

\vskip 10pt

Solving for $Q$:

$$\hbox{Re} = {{(3160) G_f Q} \over {D \mu}}$$

$$Q = {(\hbox{Re}) D \mu \over 3160 G_f}$$

$$Q = {(20000) (7.981) (1) \over (3160) (1)}$$

$$Q = {(20000) (7.981) (1) \over (3160) (1)}$$

$$Q = 50.51 \hbox{ GPM}$$

{\bf Prep Quiz:}

If the volumetric flow rate through a vortex flowmeter suddenly doubles, the shedding frequency of the flowmeter will:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Halve (${1 \over 2} \times$) 
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Remain the same
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Double (2$\times$)
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Triple (3$\times$)
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Quadruple (4$\times$)
\vskip 5pt 
\item{} Increase by 8$\times$ 
\end{itemize}
