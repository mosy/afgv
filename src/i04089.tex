Suppose we need to install a flowmeter in a location where there is plenty of upstream straight-length pipe, but no downstream straight-length pipe (i.e. the flowmeter immediately discharges into an elbow).  Identify the most appropriate technologies from this list, and explain why they others will not work:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Magnetic
\item{} Coriolis
\item{} Ultrasonic
\item{} Vortex
\item{} Positive displacement
\item{} Venturi tube
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

\noindent
These flowmeter technologies will work, because they do not require downstream flow conditioning:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Coriolis
\item{} Venturi tube
\item{} Positive displacement
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These flowmeter technologies will {\bf not} work for this application because they require downstream flow conditioning:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Magnetic
\item{} Ultrasonic
\item{} Vortex
\end{itemize}
