Explain what the following notation means: 1s$^{2}$2s$^{2}$2p$^{6}$3s$^{2}$3p$^{1}$

\vskip 10pt

Define the word ``orbital'' as it applies to atomic electrons.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} 1s$^{2}$ means 2 electrons reside in the ``s'' subshell of the first (K) shell {\it (filled to capacity)}
\item{} 2s$^{2}$ means 2 electrons reside in the ``s'' subshell of the second (L) shell {\it (filled to capacity)}
\item{} 2p$^{6}$ means 2 electrons reside in the ``p'' subshell of the second (L) shell {\it (only one out of three orbitals in this subshell filled to capacity)}
\item{} 3s$^{2}$ means 2 electrons reside in the ``s'' subshell of the third (M) shell {\it (filled to capacity)}
\item{} 3p$^{1}$ means 1 electron resides in the ``p'' subshell of the third (M) shell
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

An ``orbital'' is a {\it pair} of electrons comprising all or part of a subshell.  This means each subshell holds an {\it even} maximum number of electrons.
