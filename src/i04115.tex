When acid attacks metal, the result is typically a release of hydrogen gas and the production of a {\it salt}.  If we immerse a piece of solid zinc metal (Zn) is into liquid sulfuric acid (H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$), we see this general tendency in the production of hydrogen gas (H$_{2}$) and a salt called zinc sulfate (ZnSO$_{4}$).  The chemical equation describing this reaction is shown here:

$$\hbox{Zn} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{SO}_4 \to \hbox{ZnSO}_4 + \hbox{H}_2$$

For every single atom of zinc, it takes one molecule of sulfuric acid to react.  The reaction products for the one atom of zinc and one molecule of sulfuric acid will be one molecule of zinc sulfate and one molecule of hydrogen.

Identify how many moles of zinc metal and how many moles of pure sulfuric acid will be required to produce 15 moles of hydrogen gas.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

15 moles of zinc and 15 moles of sulfuric acid are needed to produce 15 moles of hydrogen gas, since the molecular ratio for all reactants and products is 1:1.
