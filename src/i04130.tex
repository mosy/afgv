Calculate the sodium ion molarity of a solution made from 0.05 moles of table salt (NaCl) completely dissolved in 30 cups of water.

Calculate the chlorine ion molarity of a solution made from 0.05 moles of table salt (NaCl) completely dissolved in 30 cups of water.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Molarity of sodium ions in the saltwater solution = 0.05 mol / 7.098 liters = 0.007045 $M$

\vskip 10pt

Molarity of chlorine ions in the saltwater solution = 0.05 mol / 7.098 liters = 0.007045 $M$

\vskip 10pt

The molarities are equal because sodium chloride (NaCl) completely dissociates into Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ ions in solution, with equal molecular quantities.  For every mole of Na$^{+}$ originating from the salt, there will be one mole of Cl$^{-}$ in the solution as well.
