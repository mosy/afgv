%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\it Force} (symbol: {\bf F}) is that agency responsible for altering the velocity of any mass.

Measured in {\it pounds} (English), abbreviated as ``lb''; and {\it newtons} (Metric), abbreviated ``N''.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Mathematically defined, force is the product (multiplication) of {\it mass} and {\it acceleration}: 

$$F = ma$$
 
The primary English unit for measuring force is the {\it pound}, abbreviated as ``lb''.  However, since the {\it pound} is also used to express the mass of an object (its inertia, or opposition to change in velocity), the term ``pound force,'' abbreviated ``lbf'' is often used to distinguish the motive agency of {\it force} from the ``pound mass,'' abbreviates ``lbm,'' the expression of an object's inertia.
 
The primary metric unit for measuring force is the {\it newton}, abbreviated ``N''.
