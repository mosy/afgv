Read relevant portions of the ``Rosemount Model 389 Combination pH/ORP Sensor'' instruction manual (publication PN 51-389, revision 1), and answer the following questions:

\vskip 10pt

Identify whether this is a preamplified probe or a ``passive'' (unamplified) probe.

\vskip 10pt

Based on the wiring diagrams showing how to connect this probe to various pH transmitter instruments, identify which wire colors on the model 389 cable connect to which sensing elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Measurement electrode: \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Reference electrode: \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} RTD (2 wires): \underbar{\hskip 50pt} and \underbar{\hskip 50pt}
\end{itemize}

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Explain how we can tell the model 389-01 (``option 01'') probe has a built-in preamplifier circuit, just by examining the screw terminal labels on the pH instruments it is designed to connect to.
\item{} Discuss ideas for identifying ``relevant portions'' of a text so you do not have to read the whole thing.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This model of probe has a built-in amplifier, except for probes ordered with option 02 (see page 1).

\noindent
For the model 389-01-54 amplified probe (from pages 7 and 11):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Measurement electrode: \underbar{\bf Black} 
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Reference electrode: \underbar{\bf Shield/clear}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} RTD (2 wires): \underbar{\bf White} and \underbar{\bf Red}
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
For the model 389-01-XX-55 amplified probe (from pages 13 and 18):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Measurement electrode: \underbar{\bf Black} 
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Reference electrode: \underbar{\bf Grey}
\vskip 5pt
\item{} RTD (3 wires): \underbar{\bf White}, \underbar{\bf Red}, and \underbar{\bf White/Red}
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
For the model 389-02-54 unamplified probe (from page 9 and pages 15-17):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Measurement electrode: \underbar{\bf Orange} center wire of coax
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Reference electrode: \underbar{\bf Braid} wire of coax (``Shield/bus'')
\vskip 5pt
\item{} RTD (2 wires): \underbar{\bf White} and \underbar{\bf Red}
\end{itemize}
