Examine this P\&ID and answer the following questions:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04199x01.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Identify the ``normal'' mode of operation for this system: the status of the process valve and of the solenoid valve, with the four-way hand valve in the position shown.

\vskip 10pt

Explain what type of electrical signal status (power applied or power removed) is required at the solenoid valve to force a ``fail'' state at the process valve.

\vskip 10pt

Identify the purpose of having the four-way hand valve in this system.  Under what condition(s) would it ever be set to its other position (opposite from what is shown here)?

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} The usage of the word ``normal'' is very different when describing a solenoid coil's energization state versus when the same word is used to describe a spring-return valve being ``normally-open'' or ``normally-closed.''  Explain how these two meanings differ, and why this distinction -- though confusing it may be -- is important to understand.
\item{} Identify the type of process valve used in this system, from the symbol.
\item{} Devise a procedure by which the solenoid valve could be routinely tested for proper operation without interrupting the process (i.e. without causing PV-25 to go to its failed position).
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The design engineer made it so that air will pass from the I/P to the process valve actuator during typical (good) operating conditions.  

\vskip 10pt

Energization of the solenoid valve is what will cause the process valve to go to its fail state, whatever that is (it is unspecified in the diagram).

\vskip 10pt

The purpose of the four-way hand valve is to bypass the trip solenoid, so that the control valve always receives air pressure directly from the I/P transducer.  This bypass mode might be useful if one is testing the automatic ``trip'' system and does not want to actually bring the process valve to its fail position.  You could tell that the trip solenoid energizes by listening to it (or detecting its magnetic field), thus ensuring the automatic trip system did its job by sending power to the solenoid, without causing the process valve to go to its fail-state.




\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Virtual Trip-testing} \vrule} \hrule}

This question is a good candidate for a ``Virtual Trip-testing'' exercise.  Presenting the diagram to students, you pose an assignment whereby students must figure out how to test some component of this system to check that it will operate as intended to shut down the system in an abnormal (trip) condition, with some realistic limitation (e.g. power cannot be shut off to the load).  Students then propose various methods for executing the test.  Your job is to determine whether or not their proposed tests will achieve the desired result(s).

During and after the exercise, it is good to ask students follow-up questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Where might our planned test strategy go wrong?  In other words, what thing(s) might happen to foil our test, either to invalidate the results or to not honor the stated limitation(s)?
\item{} Suppose the limitation were different.  How would this affect our ability to carry out the test?
\item{} Is the last test strategy best one we could execute?
\end{itemize}
