A level transmitter needs to be installed in a process where the liquid density happens to change over time (anywhere from 59 lb/ft$^{3}$ to 63 lb/ft$^{3}$, unpredictably) but the vapor density remains constant.  Determine whether or not each of the following level-sensing instruments would be appropriate for this application (i.e. whether or not each technology would yield reliable and reasonably accurate measurements of process level):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Hydrostatic: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Magnetostrictive (float): {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Guided-wave radar: {\it appropriate} or {\it inappropriate}?
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Hydrostatic: {\bf inappropriate}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Magnetostrictive (float): {\bf appropriate} ({\it ``inappropriate'' also considered as an answer because liquid density changes will cause small changes in float buoyancy})
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Guided-wave radar: {\bf appropriate}
\end{itemize}
