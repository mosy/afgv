The symbol ``d'' means ``a little bit of.''  So, $dx$ refers to a little bit of $x$, or an indefinitely small piece of $x$.

\vskip 10pt

The symbol ``$\int$'' means ``the sum of.''  So, $\int dx$ means the sum of all the little bits of $x$, which is simply equal to $x$.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} This reading assignment covers some very fundamental principles, and as such students' active reading of the text should be scutinized.  Are they taking comprehensive notes?  Are they expressing concepts in their own terms?  Your Socratic discussions with students should mirror the points listed in Question 0.

{\bf Prep Quiz:}

Sylvanus Thompson defines two common calculus symbols $d$ and $\int$ by the following common-sense phrases:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $d$ = ``the sum of'' ; $\int$ = ``a large chunk of''
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $d$ = ``a large chunk of'' ; $\int$ = ``the difference between''
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $d$ = ``infinity'' ; $\int$ = ``zero''
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $d$ = ``a little bit of'' ; $\int$ = ``the sum of'' 
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $d$ = ``zero'' ; $\int$ = ``infinity''
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $d$ = ``the sum of'' ; $\int$ = ``the difference between''
\end{itemize}
