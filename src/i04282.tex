Read the sections of the Fisher ``2506 Series Receiver-Controller'' product bulletin (document 34.3:2506) pertaining to the model 2506 Multi-Trol (ignore portions discussing the model 2516), and answer the following questions:

\vskip 10pt

Identify the adjustable range of gain for this controller, expressed as a gain ratio (not as a proportional band value).

\vskip 10pt

Explain how the ``reversing switch'' is used to switch the controller action between {\it direct} and {\it reverse}.  Identify whether the controller shown in figure 4 is configured for direct or reverse action.

\vskip 10pt

Identify how this pneumatic controller mechanism would respond to a slight leak in the ``proportional'' bellows, explaining your reasoning.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Proportional band = 0\% to 100\%, so gain is adjustable from 1 to infinity.

\vskip 10pt

The reversing switch swaps connections between the two bellows on the left-hand side of the beam.  The pictured configuration is {\it direct-acting}, where an increasing PV signal drives the output signal up.

\vskip 10pt

A slight leak in the proportional bellows will cause the relay to output an even greater pressure in an effort to re-balance the beam.
