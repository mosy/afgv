\noindent
Configure the controller as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Control action = {\it reverse}
\item{} Gain = {\it one-tenth the value yielding optimal control} = {\it ten times the proportional band value yielding optimal control}
\item{} Reset (Integral) = {\it 1 minute/repeat} = {\it 1 repeat/minute}
\item{} Rate (Derivative) = {\it minimum effect} = {\it 0 minutes} 
\end{itemize}

Use the controller's manual mode to establish the process variable at approximately 50\%, then switch to automatic mode.  Make a sudden setpoint adjustment (at least 10\%, in either direction) and observe the controller's {\it slow} integral-action response to this change.

Try increasing the ``aggressiveness'' of the integral action (i.e. more repeats per minute, or fewer minutes per repeat) until a more satisfactory control response is seen from the controller.  Without adjusting the controller's gain (proportional action), experiment with different integral settings until good control response is seen with large setpoint changes.  Your goal is to achieve a quality of control that eliminates offset quickly while minimizing ``overshoot'' and oscillation of the process variable.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Explain in your own words why more ``repeats per minute'' yields a more aggressive integral response, and why more ``minutes per repeat'' yields a tamer integral response.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Lesson:} finding the right reset time for a controller with integral action is a compromise between rapid response and loop stability.
