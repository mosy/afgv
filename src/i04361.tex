%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I recommend assigning half-credit for the correct explanation of cavitation ({\bf liquid spontaneously vaporizing as pressure falls at the control valve's vena contracta, then re-condensing back into liquid}) and half-credit for the explanation of its destructive effects ({\bf liquid micro-jets form as the condensing vapor bubbles collapse asymmetrically, creating pressure points on the valve components upwards of 220,000 PSI}).
