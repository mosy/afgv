Determine the approximate value of the {\it derivative} ($dy \over dx$) for this function where $x=-3$:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04378x01.eps}$$

Choose the closest answer:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} $dy \over dx$ = +1
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $dy \over dx$ = $-1$
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $dy \over dx$ = +3
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $dy \over dx$ = $-3$
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $dy \over dx$ = +5
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $dy \over dx$ = $-5$
\vskip 10pt 
\item{} $dy \over dx$ = 0
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What is most important when solving problems such as this is to be able to explain {\it why} (not just {\it how}) to arrive at the correct value.  Try explaining the process of differentiation in your own words, as it applies to this particular problem.
\item{} Identify what would have to be different about this function for the derivative at $x = -3$ to have the opposite sign that it does now.
