Using a serial terminal emulator programs on two personal computers, transfer {\it files} from one computer to the other.  I recommend creating simple graphics files using a sketching program such as Microsoft Windows ``Paint'' for this exercise.  Bitmapped graphics files tend to be large in size, and will provide your serial-communication network some challenge to quickly transfer without errors.

Note: you will need to research the file-transfer options provided by the particular terminal programs used on each computer to ensure compatibility.
