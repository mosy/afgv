This control system tries to maintain the water level at a constant value inside the boiler's steam drum by adding ``feed'' water to the bottom drum as steam evaporates off the top drum:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04431x01.eps}$$

Assuming both the level transmitter (LT) and I/P converter (LY) are direct-acting (i.e. increasing input = increasing output), and that the level controller is perfectly tuned, answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Determine the proper control action of the LIC (either {\it direct} or {\it reverse}).
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Calculate the necessary $C_v$ rating of the feedwater valve, assuming a maximum desired flowrate of 85 gallons per minute with a pump pressure of 380 PSIG and a boiler pressure of 350 PSIG.
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Determine what will happen to the boiler water level ({\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it remain essentially constant}) if an operator slightly opens the manual bypass valve when the boiler is in ``standby'' mode with zero steam usage.  Normally, this manual bypass valve is in the fully closed position.
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Determine what will happen to the controller output signal ({\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it remain essentially constant}) if an operator slightly opens the manual bypass valve when the boiler is in ``standby'' mode with zero steam usage.  Normally, this manual bypass valve is in the fully closed position.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Each correct answer is worth 2.5 points:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} The LIC must be {\bf direct} acting.
\vskip 10pt
\item{} $C_v$ = 15.519
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The boiler water level will {\bf increase} if an operator slightly opens the manual bypass valve.
\vskip 10pt
\item{} The controller output signal will {\bf remain essentially constant} (at full 100\% signal) if an operator slightly opens the manual bypass valve.  Also give credit for {\bf increase}, because a student may envision the controller signal increasing beyond 100\% as the controller tries to close the valve even tighter.
\end{itemize}
