Suppose a voltmeter registers 0 volts between test points {\bf C} and {\bf E} in this series-parallel circuit:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04484x01.eps}$$

Identify the likelihood of each specified fault for this circuit.  Consider each fault one at a time (i.e. no coincidental faults), determining whether or not each fault could independently account for {\it all} measurements and symptoms in this circuit.

Finally, identify the {\it next} diagnostic test or measurement you would make on this system.  Explain how the result(s) of this next test or measurement help further identify the location and/or nature of the fault.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Any zero-voltage measurement where there ought to be voltage indicates either an open fault preventing power from reaching those points, a shorted fault between those points preventing a voltage drop from developing, or a shorted fault upstream that diverts all current away so that no power reaches those points.

A good ``next step'' would be to measure voltage between test points C and D (across resistor $R_2$).  If the problem is either a dead power source or shorted $R_2$, we will read 0 volts here as well.  If on the other hand we read 16 volts, the problem must be either an open $R_1$ or a shorted $R_3$.
