The {\tt grades\_template} spreadsheet provided for you on the Y: network drive allows you to calculate your grade for any course (by entering exam scores, attendance data, etc.) as well as project to the future for courses you have not yet taken.  Download the spreadsheet file (if you have not done so yet) and calculate the grade a student would earn in the INST230 course (Motor Controls) given the following data:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Lab objectives complete = {\it (all passed)}
\item{} Lab score = {\it 88\%}
\item{} Mastery exam pass = {\it (passed)}
\item{} Mastery exam score = {\it 55\%}
\item{} Proportional exam score = {\it 61\%}
\item{} Quizzes failed = {\it 4}
\item{} \# of late arrivals = {\it 3}
\item{} Hours absent = {\it 5}
\item{} Sick hours = {\it 0}
\end{itemize}

Also, locate the pages in your course worksheet entitled ``Sequence of Second-Year Instrumentation Courses'' to identify which courses you will need to register for next quarter.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Why do you suppose this spreadsheet is provided to you, rather than the instructor simply posting your grades or notifying you of your progress in the program courses?
\item{} Identify any courses that are {\it elective} rather than required for your 2-year AAS degree.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

You may locate the {\tt grades\_template} on the {\tt Y:} network drive at BTC, provided you log in to the computer system using your individual student ID and password (not a generic login such as ``btc'').  It is also available for download at the {\it Socratic Instrumentation} website.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have students show you their spreadsheet templates in action, then ask them to modify the entered data to see the effect each one has on the calculated grade.
