Sketch the wires necessary to connect two proximity switches and two solid-state relay coils to the following Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1000 PLC (model 1761-L10BWA, with 6 discrete DC inputs either sourcing or sinking, and 4 discrete relay contact outputs).  Connect the sourcing switch to input {\tt I:0/0}, the sinking switch to input {\tt I:0/4}, and the two solid-state relays to outputs {\tt O:0/1} and {\tt O:0/2}:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What advantages do {\it solid-state} relays enjoy over their electromechanical counterparts?
\item{} Can these solid-state relays switch DC, AC, or both?
\item{} Identify how the behavior of a TRIAC differs from that of a bipolar or field-effect transistor.
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Note: standard electronic proximity switch wiring color codes are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\bf Brown} = Positive (+) DC supply
\item{} {\bf Blue} = Negative ($-$) DC supply
\item{} {\bf Black} = Signal output
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is just one possible solution:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04524x02.eps}$$

Note that this solution shows the two solid-state relays connected to the PLC output such that the PLC {\it sinks} current from the relays.  Since no instructions were given on wiring the PLC outputs, this is just one possible solution out of many.
