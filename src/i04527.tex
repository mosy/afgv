Suppose we have an Allen-Bradley model ``SLC 500'' PLC connected to a three switches and two AC loads (a lamp and a solenoid coil) as shown in this illustration:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04527x01.eps}$$

The following is the PLC's program as it appears printed on paper.  From this information, determine the status of the lamp and of the solenoid coil provided a process pressure of 130 PSI, a process temperature of 186 $^{o}$F, and an unpressed pushbutton switch:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Both the lamp and the solenoid coil will be energized:

This question is a good candidate for a ``Virtual Troubleshooting'' exercise.  Presenting the diagram to students, you first imagine in your own mind a particular fault in the system.  Then, you present one or more symptoms of that fault (something noticeable by an operator or other user of the system).  Students then propose various diagnostic tests to perform on this system to identify the nature and location of the fault, as though they were technicians trying to troubleshoot the problem.  Your job is to tell them what the result(s) would be for each of the proposed diagnostic tests, documenting those results where all the students can see.

During and after the exercise, it is good to ask students follow-up questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What does the result of the last diagnostic test tell you about the fault?
\item{} Suppose the results of the last diagnostic test were different.  What then would that result tell you about the fault?
\item{} Is the last diagnostic test the best one we could do?
\item{} What would be the ideal order of tests, to diagnose the problem in as few steps as possible?
\end{itemize}

The following is the PLC's program as it appears printed on paper.  From this information, determine the status of the lamp and of the solenoid coil provided a process pressure of 130 PSI, a process temperature of 186 $^{o}$F, and someone continuously pressing the pushbutton switch:
