Skim the ``ROC800 Series'' brochure from Emerson (12 pages) to specifically answer these questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Summarize the capabilities of this control system in your own words
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Identify some of the different types of signals it is able to input (given the appropriate cards)
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Identify some of the different network types this controller is able to communicate data over
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Identify some of the different programming languages used to configure this controller
\end{itemize}

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Discuss ideas for ``skimming'' a text to identify key points so you do not have to read the whole thing.
\item{} For those who have studied gas flow measurement, explain what ``AGA3'' and ``AGA7'' metering entails.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Summarize the capabilities of this control system in your own words: {\it a remotely-located controller serving the functions of RTU, Flow Computer, and PLC}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Identify some of the different types of signals it is able to input (given the appropriate cards): {\it analog, discrete, RTD, pulse}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Identify some of the different network types this controller is able to communicate data over: {\it RS-232, RS-485, Ethernet, HART}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Identify some of the different programming languages used to configure this controller: {\it the five IEC61131-3 standard languages (function block, ladder diagram, sequential function chart, structured text, instruction list) plus a graphical flowchart language}
