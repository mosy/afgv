Suppose we need an ADC to convert a 0-5 VDC signal into a digital number with a resolution {\it at least} as fine as $\pm$ 0.35 millivolts.  First, determine the minimum number of output bits this ADC should have, and then express its output signal value in hexadecimal form for an input voltage of 2.37 volts:

\vskip 10pt

Minimum number of output bits = \underbar{\hskip 50pt}

\vskip 10pt

Output value at 2.37 volt input = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} (hexadecimal)

\underbar{file i04563}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Minimum number of output bits = \underbar{\bf 14}

\vskip 10pt

Output value at 2.37 volt input = \underbar{{\bf 1E55} or {\bf 1E56}} (hexadecimal)
