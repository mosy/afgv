Read and outline the ``Practical Measures of Reliability'' section of the ``Process Safety and Instrumentation'' chapter in your {\it Lessons In Industrial Instrumentation} textbook.  Note the page numbers where important illustrations, photographs, equations, tables, and other relevant details are found.  Prepare to thoughtfully discuss with your instructor and classmates the concepts and examples explored in this reading.

\noindent
In particular, focus your reading efforts to be able to define and apply these concepts:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Define what lambda ($\lambda$) and MTBF mean for a collection of components tested over time (with no replacements)
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Define what lambda ($\lambda$) and MTBF mean for a collection of components tested over time (with any failed components immediately replaced)
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Define MTBF versus {\it wear-out} time versus {\it mean life} for a component
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Define {\it reliability} (R) versus {\it probability of failure on demand} (PFD)
\end{itemize}
