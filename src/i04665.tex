Suppose we have a Siemens S7-200 PLC connected to a pair of pushbutton switches and light bulbs as shown in this illustration:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04665x01.eps}$$

Examine the following relay ladder logic (RLL) program for this Siemens PLC, determining the statuses of the two lamps provided both switches are simultaneously pressed by a human operator:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04665x02.eps}$$

Furthermore, determine the necessary switch actuation statuses (i.e. pressed versus unpressed) to turn lamp Z on.
