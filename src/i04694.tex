Oil refineries and other heavy industries dealing with large quantities of flammable gases often use {\it flares} as emergency devices to safely burn off gas vented from one or more process units.  This P\&ID of a typical flare gas system shows how liquids are ``knocked out'' of the flammable gas headed to the flare, and how flames are prevented from following back from the flare tip to the flare line by means of a water seal:

Describe the practical purpose of each controller in this P\&ID (i.e. explain the reason why we have a controller installed and working in each case), and then determine its proper action.  Assuming all transmitters are direct-acting (greater measured variable = greater signal output), determine the proper action ({\it direct} or {\it reverse}) for each controller in this system.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Knockout drum LC-24 = {\bf reverse}-acting.  The purpose of this controller is to prevent the knockout drum from filling up with condensed liquids.
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Water seal drum LC-21 = {\bf reverse}-acting.  The purpose of this controller is to maintain a stable level of water inside to maintain a seal around the incoming flare gas pipe.
\vskip 5pt
\item{} Water seal drum TC-26 = {\bf direct}-acting.  The purpose of this controller is to prevent the seal water from freezing in the wintertime.
