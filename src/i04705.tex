Identify which PID action(s) may be set to aggressive levels in a {\it liquid level control} process characterized by an integrating behavior and a relatively noise-free signal:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Aggressive proportional (gain) = {\it Yes} or {\it No}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Aggressive integral (reset) = {\it Yes} or {\it No} 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Aggressive derivative (rate) = {\it Yes} or {\it No} 
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Aggressive proportional (gain) = {\bf Yes}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Aggressive integral (reset) = {\bf No} 
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Aggressive derivative (rate) = {\bf Yes} or {\bf No} (although derivative action would not necessarily help, it should not hurt in a noiseless process)
\end{itemize}
