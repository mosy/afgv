%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\begin{itemize}
\item{} ``Compel Data'' (CD) message
\item{} ``Pass Token'' (PT) message
\item{} ``Time Distribution'' (TD) message
\item{} ``Probe Node'' (PN) message
\item{} ``Live List'' database
\end{itemize}

Answers such as ``Publisher/Subscriber'' or ``Unscheduled'' are much too vague, and deserve no credit.
