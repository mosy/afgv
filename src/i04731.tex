When using any particular type of cable in a Fieldbus H1 network segment, one must be sure not to exceed the total maximum length limit for that cable type.  When mixing multiple cable types in the same network segment, one must be sure to abide by this formula:

$$\left({x_A \over A_{max}}\right) + \left({x_B \over B_{max}}\right) + \left({x_C \over C_{max}}\right) + \left({x_D \over D_{max}}\right)\leq 1$$

\noindent
Where,

$x_{A,B,C,D}$ = total length of each cable type in the segment

$A_{max}$ = Maximum permissible length for cable type A = 1900 meters

$B_{max}$ = Maximum permissible length for cable type B = 1200 meters

$C_{max}$ = Maximum permissible length for cable type C = 400 meters

$D_{max}$ = Maximum permissible length for cable type D = 200 meters

\vskip 10pt

Suppose an H1 segment already contains 850 meters of type A cable, 210 meters of type B cable, and 61 meters of type C cable.  How much type D cable may be added to this segment without exceeding the total limit allowed by the formula?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

No more than 45.026 meters of type D cable are allowed in this segment!
