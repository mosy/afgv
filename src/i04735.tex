{\bf Energy stored in a capacitor:}

$$U = {1 \over 2}CV^2$$

\noindent
Where,

$U$ = Energy stored in capacitor, in Joules (J)

$C$ = Capacitance, in Farads (F)

$V$ = Voltage across capacitor terminals, in volts (V)

{\bf Energy stored in an inductor:}

$$U = {1 \over 2}LI^2$$

\noindent
Where,

$U$ = Energy stored in inductor, in Joules (J)

$L$ = Inductance, in Henrys (H)

$I$ = Current through inductor coil, in amperes (A)

{\bf Probability Laws:}

$$P(\hbox{A {\it and} B}) = P(\hbox{A}) \times P(\hbox{B})$$

$$P(\hbox{A {\it or} B}) = P(B) + P(A) - P(A) \times P(B)$$

$$P(\hbox{A {\it exclusively or} B}) = P(A) + P(B)$$

{\bf Reliability formulae:}

$$\lambda = {{dN_f \over dt} \over N_s} \hbox{\hskip 30pt or \hskip 30pt} \lambda = {{dN_f \over dt} {1 \over N_s}}$$

$$N_{s} = N_o e^{-\lambda t} \hskip 30pt N_{f} = N_o \left(1 - e^{-\lambda t}\right)$$

\noindent
Where,

$\lambda$ = Failure rate

$N_f$ = Number of components failed during testing period

$N_s$ = Number of components surviving during testing period

$N_o$ = Original number of components at start of test

$t$ = Time

\noindent
{\bf Reliability formulae (continued):}

$$\lambda = {{N_f \over t} \over N_o} \hbox{\hskip 30pt or \hskip 30pt} \lambda = {{N_f \over t} {1 \over N_o}}$$

\noindent
Where,

$\lambda$ = Failure rate

$N_f$ = Number of components failed during testing period

$N_o$ = Number of components under test (maintained constant) during testing period by immediate replacement of failed components

$t$ = Time

\vskip 10pt


$$R_{system} = R_1 \times R_2 \times R_3 \times \cdots \times R_n$$

$$\hbox{MTBF} = {1 \over \lambda}$$

$$R + \hbox{PFD} = 1$$

\vskip 10pt

$$R = e^{-\lambda t}$$

\noindent
Where,

$R$ = Reliability as a function of time (sometimes shown as $R(t)$

$e$ = Euler's constant ($\approx 2.71828$)

$\lambda$ = Failure rate (assumed to be a constant during the useful life period)

$t$ = Time
