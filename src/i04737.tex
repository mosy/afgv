Suppose an engineer decides to place a 15 horsepower AC electric motor in a Class 1, Division 1 area.  He decides the best way to make this installation safe is to run the motor's power through an intrinsically safe barrier circuit.  Do you agree with this plan or not?  If not, why not?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

IS barriers limit energy delivered to the field device to very low levels -- far lower than what is required to run a 15 HP electric motor!
