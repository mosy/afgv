Suppose an engineer decides to place a Rosemount model 1151 differential pressure transmitter inside a NEMA-1 (sheet metal with no door seal) enclosure, in a Class 1, Division 1 area.  He declares that this is permissible because transmitter and all its wiring has been installed according to ``intrinsically safe'' standards (including an intrinsic safety barrier installed back at the control room), and therefore there is no need to place the transmitter inside a NEMA-7 (explosion-proof) enclosure.  Do you agree with this assessment or not?  If not, explain what must be done to make this a safe installation.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

So long as the circuit is intrinsically safe (as made by the I.S. barrier), the type of enclosure does not matter one bit.
