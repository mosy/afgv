%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

5 points for correct definition of ``Class'' and 5 points for correct definition of ``Division''.

\vskip 10pt

``Class'' refers to the type of explosive hazard (e.g. vapors, dust, fibers) while ``Division'' refers to the frequency of the hazard (e.g. likely present versus unlikely to be present).  

\vskip 10pt

If the student gets the basic concept correct (e.g. ``Class'' refers to the type of hazard, or the size of the particles) but gets the number/association incorrect (e.g. Class I is for dust), they only get 2 points out of 5 for that portion.
