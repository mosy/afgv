Suppose a boy working on a farm needs to draw water out of an open well.  The water is 23 feet below ground level, and the boy has a 1-gallon bucket with a rope enabling him to manually lift water to the surface.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the amount of work the boy must do to lift 1 gallon of water out of the well.  Assume the bucket itself weighs 1.5 pounds, but neglect the weight of the rope (for simplicity):

\vskip 10pt

Work = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} ft-lb

\vskip 30pt

If the boy is able to lift this much water out of the well in 8 seconds, how much is his power output (in units of horsepower)?

\vskip 10pt

Power = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} HP

\vskip 10pt

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Calculating the weight of the water lifted:

$$\left(1 \hbox{ gal of water} \over 1 \right) \left(231 \hbox{ in}^3 \over 1 \hbox{ gal}\right) \left(1 \hbox{ ft}^3 \over 1728 \hbox{ in}^3\right) \left(62.4 \hbox{ lb} \over 1 \hbox{ ft}^3 \hbox{ of water}\right) = 8.342 \hbox{ lb}$$

Added to the 1.5 pound weight of the bucket, the boy's total upward force must be 9.842 pounds.
 
\vskip 10pt

Since the displacement of the boy's effort must be the depth of the water (23 feet), the work done is a simple product of these two figures:

$$W = F x = (9.842 \hbox{ lb}) (23 \hbox{ ft}) = 226.36 \hbox{ ft-lb}$$

\vskip 10pt

Power is equal to work done per unit time, so:

$$P = {W \over t} = {226.36 \hbox{ ft-lb} \over 8 \hbox{ s}} = 28.29 \hbox{ ft-lb/s}$$

Converting between ft-lb/s and horsepower:

$$\left(28.29 \hbox{ ft-lb/s} \over 1 \right) \left(1 \hbox{ HP} \over 550 \hbox{ ft-lb/s}\right) = 0.0514 \hbox{ HP}$$
