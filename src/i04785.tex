Crude oil flows at an average velocity of 10 feet per second through a pipe with an internal diameter of 5.95 inches.  Calculate the flow rate of this oil in units of gallons per minute, as well as barrels per day.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The volumetric flow rate for any fluid is equal to the flow velocity ($v$) multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the pipe ($A$):

$$Q = Av$$

We already know the velocity, so what we need to do now is calculate the pipe's flowing area.  The pipe's internal diameter of 5.95 inches gives us this cross-sectional area:

$$A = \pi r^2$$

$$A = \pi \left(5.95 \over 2 \right)^2 = 27.81 \hbox{ in}^2$$

Converting the velocity into units of {\it inches} per minute before multiplying will give us a flow rate in cubic inches per minute:

$$\left( 10 \hbox{ ft} \over \hbox{s} \right) \left(12 \hbox{ in} \over 1 \hbox{ ft} \right) \left( 60 \hbox{ s} \over 1 \hbox{ min} \right) = 7200 \hbox{ in/min}$$

Calculating volumetric flow rate:

$$Q = Av$$

$$Q = (27.81 \hbox{ in}^2) (7200 \hbox{ in/min}) = 200196.4 \hbox{ in}^3\hbox{/min}$$

Converting volumetric flow rate units:

$$\left( 200196.4 \hbox{ in}^3 \over \hbox{min} \right) \left(1 \hbox{ gal} \over 231 \hbox{ in}^3 \right) = 866.7 \hbox{ GPM}$$

$$\left( 866.7 \hbox{ gal} \over \hbox{min} \right) \left(1 \hbox{ bbl} \over 42 \hbox{ gal} \right) \left( 60 \hbox{ min} \over 1 \hbox{ hr} \right)  \left( 24 \hbox{ hr} \over 1 \hbox{ day} \right) = 29713.8 \hbox{ bbl/day}$$
