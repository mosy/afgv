A {\it stroboscope} is a bright strobe light designed to be used for measuring the shaft speed of a rotating machine.  When flashed at the same frequency as the shaft's rotation, the effect is to make the shaft look as though it is stationary even while it is spinning.

\vskip 10pt

Suppose a stroboscope is used to ``freeze'' the rotation of an AC motor's shaft, and the flash frequency is noted to be 29.3 Hz.  Calculate the speed of the motor shaft, and then determine both the number of poles inside this motor and whether or not it is an {\it induction} motor or a {\it synchronous} motor.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

29.3 Hz is 29.3 flashes per second, which when matching the shaft's speed equates to 29.3 revolutions per second.  This is equivalent to 1758 RPM.
 
\vskip 10pt

This must be a 4-pole, induction AC motor operating on a 60 Hz power supply, since 1800 RPM is the synchronous speed of a 4-pole machine at 60 Hz.  The slip speed of this induction motor is 1800 $-$ 1758 = 42 RPM.
