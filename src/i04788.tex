%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The Continuity equation relates volumetric flow rate to pipe area and average velocity, assuming a constant fluid density:

$$Q = A v$$

Velocity may be determined by manipulating this equation and plugging in the known quantities in the proper units:

$$v = {Q \over A}$$

First, we need to convert the flow rate into units of cubic inches per minute, and calculate area in square inches:

$$Q = \left(180 \hbox{ gal} \over \hbox{min} \right) \left(231 \hbox{ in}^3 \over 1 \hbox{ gal} \right) = 41580 \hbox{ in}^3\hbox{/min}$$

$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi (3 \hbox{ in})^2 = 28.27 \hbox{ in}^2$$

Now we may calculate average velocity:

$$v = {Q \over A} = {41580 \hbox{ in}^3\hbox{/min} \over 28.27 \hbox{ in}^2} = 1470.6 \hbox{ in/min}$$
