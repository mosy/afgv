The Siemens model SGT-800 gas turbine engine has an output power of approximately 47 megawatts.  The turbine itself spins at 6608 RPM, but the 2-pole AC generator must spin at a different speed in order to generate 50 Hz electrical power for European power markets.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the gear ratio necessary to couple the turbine's shaft to the generator's shaft, and identify whether this gear set needs to {\it reduce} speed or {\it increase} speed.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A 50 Hz, 2-pole generator must spin at 3000 RPM exactly (50 revolutions per second).  We therefore require a {\it reduction} gear set between the turbine and the generator with a gear ratio of 2.203:1 ($6608 \over 3000$).
