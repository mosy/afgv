The General Electric ``Frame 6'' gas turbine engine is a popular choice for natural gas powered electrical generators in the United States, with an output power of approximately 42 megawatts.  The turbine itself spins at 5163 RPM, but the 2-pole AC generator must spin at a different speed in order to generate 60 Hz electrical power.

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the gear ratio necessary to couple the turbine's shaft to the generator's shaft, and identify whether this gear set needs to {\it reduce} speed or {\it increase} speed.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A 60 Hz, 2-pole generator must spin at 3600 RPM exactly (60 revolutions per second).  We therefore require a {\it reduction} gear set between the turbine and the generator with a gear ratio of 1.434:1 ($5163 \over 3600$).
