Calculate the RPM of the engine in a truck as it drives down the highway at 70 MPH with 30-inch tall wheels and an axle gear speed reduction ratio of 3.55:1, in top gear (a transmission ratio of 1:1).

\vskip 10pt

Next, calculate the engine's RPM at the same highway speed if the truck is equipped with an {\it overdrive} gear in the transmission (turning the axle driveshaft faster than the engine is turning), having an effective ratio of 0.7:1.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Each revolution of the truck's 30-inch diameter wheels is equivalent to $30 \pi$ inches of linear motion along the highway.  Converting 70 miles per hour into inches per minute, and then from linear inches per minute into revolutions per minute, gives us the rotational speed of the wheels:

$$\left(70 \hbox{ miles} \over \hbox{hour} \right) \left(5280 \hbox{ feet} \over 1 \hbox{ mile} \right) \left(12 \hbox{ inches} \over 1 \hbox{ foot} \right) \left(1 \hbox{ rev} \over 30 \pi \hbox{ inches} \right) \left(1 \hbox{ hour} \over 60 \hbox{ minutes} \right) = 784.3 \hbox{ RPM}$$

Since the axle's gear ratio is a speed {\it reducer} from driveshaft to wheels, it acts as a speed {\it increaser} from wheels to driveshaft.  Thus, with a ratio of 3.55:1, the driveshaft will spin at a speed of 2784.3 RPM.
 
\vskip 10pt

With a transmission ratio of 1:1, this means the engine will also spin at 2784.3 RPM.

\vskip 10pt

With an overdrive transmission ratio of 0.7:1, this means the engine will also spin at 1949.0 RPM.
