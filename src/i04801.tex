At the skate park, Riley accidently lets go of his 4 kilogram skateboard at the top of a 5-meter tall ramp.  Assuming a frictionless ride down the ramp, how fast will Riley's skateboard be rolling at the bottom of the ramp?

\vskip 10pt

$v$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} m/s

\vskip 10pt

How much potential energy did Riley's skateboard have when it was 5 meters above ground level (at the top of the ramp)?

\vskip 10pt

$E_p$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} Joules




\underbar{file i04801}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$v = \sqrt{2 g h} = \sqrt{(2)(9.81)(5)}$ = \underbar{9.90} m/s

\vskip 10pt

$E_p = mgh = (4)(9.81)(5)$ = \underbar{196.2} Joules
