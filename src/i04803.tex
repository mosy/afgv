Suppose a forklift hoists a container weighing 2670 pounds up from ground level, setting it down on a loading dock 4.5 feet above ground level.  How much work was done by the forklift in this maneuver?

\vskip 10pt

$W$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} ft-lbs

\vskip 10pt

Now suppose the same forklift moves the container off of the loading dock and into the back of a flatbed truck 3 feet above ground level.  How much work was done by the forklift in this maneuver?

\vskip 10pt

$W$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} ft-lbs

\underbar{file i04803}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Moving from ground level to loading dock:

$W$ = \underbar{12015} ft-lbs

\vskip 10pt

Moving from loading dock to flatbed truck:

$W$ = \underbar{$-$4005} ft-lbs
