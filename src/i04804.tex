A bullet's speed is measured to be 1460 feet per second.  Use unity fractions to convert this speed into {\it miles per hour}.  You may use any of the following conversion equivalents in your work, but whatever you do you {\it must} show how you obtained the correct answer by using ``unity fractions'' to cancel out all unwanted units and replace with desired units:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} 24 hours = 1 day
\vskip 5pt
\item{} 1 yard = 3 feet
\vskip 5pt
\item{} 1 horsepower = 746 Watts
\vskip 5pt
\item{} 1 mile = 5280 feet
\vskip 5pt
\item{} 1 PSI = 2.036 "Hg
\vskip 5pt
\item{} 1 acre = 43560 square feet
\end{itemize}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\left(1460 \hbox{ feet} \over \hbox{second} \right) \left(1 \hbox{ mile} \over 5280 \hbox{ feet}\right) \left(60 \hbox{ seconds} \over 1 \hbox{ minute}\right) \left(60 \hbox{ minutes} \over 1 \hbox{ hour}\right) = 995.5 \hbox{ MPH}$$
