%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

``AC'' flowmeters indeed use alternating current to energize their field windings, but ``DC'' meters do not use steady direct current.  Rather, ``DC'' flowmeters use {\it pulsed} magnetic fields, sometimes of consistent polarity and other times with reversing polarity (making them ``alternating'' after all!).

Dual-frequency magflow meters attempt to capitalize on the best features of both DC and AC techniques, by employing specialized pulse waveforms.

\vskip 10pt

DC magflow meters enjoy good rejection of ``noise'' voltages, while AC magflow meters typically exhibit faster response times.
