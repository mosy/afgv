Et nyinstallert pH målesystem ser ikke ut til å måle rett pH verdi på prosessvæsken. Regulatoren som systemet er tilkoblet viser ikke samme verdi som et håndholdt pH-meter om en operatør holder ned i væsken. 


$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00976x01.eps}$$

Måleområde til den 4 leder koblede transmitteren skal være 2-12 pH, med et utgangssignal på 4-20mA. En automatiker som har startet feilsøking ved å måle strømmen som transmitteren sender ut med en loopkalibrator. Dette gir et resultat på 15.43 mA. 


\vskip 10pt

Ut fra dette skal du finne ut hvor problemet i systemet er. Vis også hvordan du ville koblet loopkalibratoren inn i sløyfen for å gjøre denne målingen.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Review the problem-solving tips listed in Question 0 and apply them to this problem.
\item{} A problem-solving technique useful for making proper connections in pictorial circuit diagrams is to first identify the directions of all DC currents entering and exiting component terminals, as well as the respective voltage polarity marks (+,$-$) for those terminals, based on your knowledge of each component acting either as an electrical {\it source} or an electrical {\it load}.  Discuss and compare how these arrows and polarity marks simplify the task of properly connecting wires between components. 
\item{} If the technician had no test equipment except for a voltmeter, could a good diagnostic test still be made in this system?
\item{} Identify where you could install a rectifying diode in this circuit to allow convenient measurement of loop current.
\end{itemize}

\underbar{file i00976}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

15.43 milliamps of current equates to a percentage value of 71.44\%:

$${15.43 - 4 \over 16} \times 100\% = 71.44\%$$

This, in turn, represents a pH value of:

$$0.7144 \times (12 - 2) + 2 = 9.144 \hbox{ pH}$$

\vskip 10pt

This largely agrees with the controller's display, which tells us there is a {\it slight} calibration error on either the part of the controller or the resistor.  The huge discrepancy between this calculated pH value and what the hand-held pH meter registers, however, tells us there is either a problem with the pH transmitter, the pH probe, or the hand-held meter.  We may further conclude there is no problem with the 250 $\Omega$ resistor or the indicating controller.
 
\vskip 10pt

The proper setup of the loop calibrator is to place it into the ``READ'' (measure) mode so that it functions as a simple ammeter, then connect it in series with the output of the 4-wire transmitter.  This may be done either with the indicating controller still in the circuit, or removed from the circuit.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Wire E-A failing open
\item{} Wire F-B failing open
\item{} Wire G-C failing open
\item{} Wire H-D failing open
\item{} Resistor failing open
\item{} 28 VDC power supply dying

{\bf Determining the utility of given diagnostic tests:} imagine the resistor fails open in this circuit (but don't tell this to students!).  Present the operator's observation(s) to the students, have them consider possible faults and diagnostic strategies, and then propose the following diagnostic tests one by one.  Have students rate the value of each test, determining whether or not each test would give us useful information (i.e. tell us something we don't already know).  Also have students describe what result in particular might be the most informative for any of these tests, because the same test might yield conclusive or inconclusive results depending on the fault:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Operator sees the controller PV display registering 105\% (12.5 pH)
\item{} Measure $V_{AD}$
\item{} Measure $V_{EH}$
\item{} Measure current at terminal B
\item{} Measure voltage at input terminals of controller
\item{} Measure solution pH with a hand-held meter
\item{} Place controller in manual mode and change the output value
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\bf Diagnosing a fault based on given symptoms:} imagine the wire connecting terminals F and B breaks open in this circuit (but don't tell this to students!).  Present the operator's observation(s) to the students, have them consider possible faults and diagnostic strategies, and then tell them the results of tests they propose based on the following symptoms, until they have properly identified the nature and location of the fault:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Operator sees the controller PV display registering -25\% (-0.5 pH)
\item{} $V_{AD}$ = 28 VDC
\item{} $V_{EH}$ = 28 VDC
\item{} $V_{FG}$ = 28 VDC
\item{} $V_{BC}$ = 0 VDC

A pneumatic DP transmitter measures the flow of gasoline through a an orifice plate, using a separate square root extractor relay to characterize the signal so that it may be displayed linearly on the receiver gauge (FI-20):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03440x01.eps}$$

Based on other flow-measuring devices in this process, operations personnel have determined the actual flow rate through this pipe is 158 gallons per minute.  FI-20, however, registers a flow of 142 gallons per minute.  Based on the data you see in this illustration, determine the location of the calibration error.

\underbar{file i03440}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

The error lies either with the DP transmitter (FT-20), unequal fluid inside the impulse tubes, or with the orifice plate itself (FE-20).  One quick check would be to drain the impulse tubes (allowing fresh process gasoline to fill the tubes) and seeing whether that fixes the problem.  It's a quick procedure and it would eliminate that problem from the realm of possibility.

Another way to diagnose the problem is to remove FT-20 from service and test its calibration with applied pressures to its ``H'' side port.  If FT-20 checks out okay, the problem must be with the impulse tubes or the orifice plate.

This transmitter definitely has a {\it span} error, and one could say it has a {\it zero} error as well:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03730x02.eps}$$

If the transmitter only had a zero error, we would see its output be offset from the ideal values by the same amount across its range.  The clue that this error is {\it span} related is how the error keeps progressing by the same amount with every interval along the 0-100\% range.  Note the error figures in this expanded table, particularly how they change by 0.2 mA with every 25\% change in applied pressure:

A level indicator is registering a liquid level that is falsely high.  The operator has hand-gauged the storage vessel with a tape measure and determined the actual level to be 8.2 feet, but the level indicator (LI) registers 10.1 feet.  The calibrated range of the 3-15 PSI pneumatic transmitter is 0 feet to 12 feet.  You measure the pneumatic pressure signal with a test gauge and find that it is 13.1 PSI.  Which instrument is at fault in this system?  How do you know?

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02961x01.eps}$$

Furthermore, identify whether the fault is a {\it zero shift}, a {\it span shift}, a problem with {\it linearity}, {\it hysteresis}, or whether it is impossible to determine from the information we have.

An important principle to apply when isolating calibration errors and other instrument loop faults is that {\it every instrument has at least one input and one output, and the signals at each of these should correlate with each other}.  Whichever instrument in a loop fails this correlation test is the one to blame.

\vskip 10pt

In this example, we may compare the known liquid level to the transmitter's output signal to see if those two values properly correlate.  If so, the transmitter is functioning properly; if not, the transmitter is at fault.  Likewise, we may compare the pneumatic signal to the indicator's reading to see if those two values properly correlate.  If so, the indicator is functioning properly; if not, the indicator is at fault.

\vskip 10pt

The measured pneumatic pressure signal of 13.1 PSI correlates to a percentage value of 84.17\%.  This agrees with the indicator's reading of 10.1 feet (in a 0-12 foot range), but it does not agree with the actual process liquid level of 8.2 feet.

\vskip 10pt

Therefore, the indicator cannot be at fault.  The only possible faults remaining are the {\bf transmitter} and the operator's {\bf hand gauge}.  Of those two, it is more likely that the transmitter has some sort of problem than a human operator missed the mark by almost two feet!  The specific nature of this fault is impossible to tell, as we have only one point of data.  If we had multiple points of data, we could better identify what type of mis-calibration error this is (e.g. zero shift versus span shift versus linearity versus hysteresis).

Sketch the necessary connecting tubes and wires to calibrate a DP transmitter to a low pressure range (somewhere in the range of a few inches of water), using a hand (bicycle-style) air pump as the pressure source and a U-tube manometer as a pressure standard.  As pressure increases, the transmitter's output signal should increase as well:

\notes{} 

This is just one solution -- others are possible:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00022x02.eps}$$

The purpose of the air tank is to add volume to the system, so that each stroke of the hand pump adds less pressure to the system.  If you have ever tried to pump up an automobile tire using a bicycle pump, you understand this principle well: it takes {\it lots} of pump strokes to inflate a car tire, but relatively few to inflate a bicycle tire, due to the vast difference in volumes between the two types of tires.  We're intentionally adding volume to this system in order to exploit the principle and thereby make each pump stroke less influential.  

If not for the air tank, just one stroke of the hand pump would likely generate enough pressure to completely blow all the water out of the manometer!

\vfil \eject

A very common mistake made by students is to connect the manometer in ``series'' between the air pump and the tank, like this:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00022x03.eps}$$

If one were to connect a manometer in this manner, it would register the {\it difference} in air pressure between the air pump and the tank rather than register the (gauge) air pressure in the tank as it should.  What we want is a system where the air pump's output gets sent to the tank with nothing in between to interfere with the air reaching its destination, and the manometer senses the pressure difference between the tank and the ambient atmospheric pressure.  Connected improperly, we would never expect the manometer's reading to agree with the pressure transmitter's reading except by chance.

This mistake would be analogous to connecting a voltmeter (an electrical ``pressure'' sensing device) in series between a voltage source (air pump) and a capacitor (tank) like this.  As with the improperly plumbed manometer, we would have no reason to expect these two voltmeters to agree:

One challenge technicians face when calibrating low-pressure instruments is how to generate very low air pressures to simulate different low-pressure conditions for the pressure instrument under test.  Measuring low pressures is no problem at all: very simple manometers will do the job quite nicely.  Most mechanical air compressors, however, generate pressures far exceeding the range of most manometers.  Though it is possible to purchase precision pressure regulators for reducing such large pressures down to a level measurable by a manometer, these devices are expensive.

A simple way to ``divide'' the pressure output of a standard pressure regulator from a few PSI to a few inches of water is to use a pair of small valves (preferably needle valves allowing for precise adjustment) to throttle the flow of compressed air and vent the regulator's output to atmosphere, then tap between those valves to obtain a reduced pressure:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00287x01.eps}$$

Complete the following schematic diagram showing an electrical model for this pneumatic system, and then explain how it works:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00287x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file i00287}

\svar{} 

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00287x03.eps}$$

I'll leave the explanation to you!

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question \#1: explain what you could do with one or both of the two needle valves to {\it increase} the amount of pressure sent to the instrument under test.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question \#2: explain why placing a valve in ``series'' with the regulator's output will {\it not} adjust pressure to the instrument under test or the manometer.

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00287x04.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 

The second follow-up question is particularly important, as novices often make this conceptual error.  They believe that placing a restriction between the pressure source and the instrument will somehow reduce the pressure going to that instrument.  In reality, it only {\it delays} changes in pressure to that instrument!  Just like a resistor placed in series with a voltmeter, a restriction cannot adjust pressure on its own where there is no flow.  As the instrument under test quite likely draws no air (it has infinite input impedance, to extend the electrical analogy), a series restriction will do nothing to reduce the pressure reaching it.

The delay comes from the volume of the tubing and of the instrument itself, acting as a capacitance to the series valve's resistance.  This forms an ``RC time constant'' with its characteristic first-order step response.

A common form of measurement error in instruments is called {\it hysteresis}.  A very similar type of measurement error is called {\it deadband}.  Describe what these errors are, and differentiate between the two.

\underbar{file i00091}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

Hysteresis and dead band are not exactly the same type of calibration error, but they are closely related.  ``Dead band'' refers to a range of instrument measurement during reversal of input where the output does not change at all.  A common example of this is a ``loose'' steering system in an automobile, where the steering wheel must be turned excessively to take up ``backlash'' (mechanical slack) in the linkage system.  

Hysteresis refers to the situation where a reversal of input causes an immediate, but not proportionate, reversal of output.  This is commonly seen in air-actuated valves, where air pressure acts against the action of a large spring to precisely position a valve mechanism.  Ideally, the valve mechanism will move proportionally to the air pressure signal sent to it, and this positioning will be both repeatable and accurate.  Unfortunately, friction in the valve mechanism produces hysteresis: a different air pressure signal may be required to position the valve mechanism at the same location opening versus closing, but unlike dead band, {\it any} amount of signal reversal (change of direction: increasing vs. decreasing) will cause the valve to move slightly.

Compare the following transfer function graphs to understand the difference between hysteresis and dead band:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00091x01.eps}$$

Both dead band and hysteresis are characteristically mechanical phenomena.  Electronic circuits rarely exhibit such ``artifacts'' of measurement or control.  Dead band and hysteresis are more often found together than separately in any instrument.

Interestingly, both effects are present in magnetic circuits.  The magnetization curves for typical transformer core steels and irons are classic examples of hysteresis, whereas the magnetization curve for ferrite (in the saturation region) is quite close to being a true representation of deadband.

An instrument technician working for a pharmaceutical processing company is given the task of calibrating a temperature recording device used to display and log the temperature of a critical batch vessel used to grow cultures of bacteria.  After removing the instrument from the vessel and bringing it to a workbench in the calibration lab, the technician connects it to a calibration standard which has the ability to simulate a wide range of temperatures.  This way, she will be able to test how the device responds to different temperatures and make adjustments if necessary.

Before making any adjustments, though, the technician first inputs the full range of temperatures to this instrument to see how it responds in its present condition.  Then, the instrument indications are recorded as {\it As-Found} data.  Only after this step is taken does the technician make corrections to the instrument's calibration.  Then, the instrument is put through one more full-range test and the indications recorded as {\it As-Left} data.

Explain why it is important that the technician make note of both ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' data?  Why not just immediately make adjustments as soon as an error is detected?  Why record any of this data at all?  Try to think of a practical scenario where this might matter.

\underbar{file i00082}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

I'll answer the question with a scenario of my own: suppose it is discovered that some patients suffered complications after taking drugs manufactured by this company, and that the particular batch of suspect drugs were processed in this very same vessel about 6 months ago?  Now imagine that this temperature recording instrument gets routinely calibrated once a month.  See the problem?

\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 

Doing both As-Found and As-Left calibration tests is important for long-term monitoring of the measurement device (usually the process {\it transmitter} tasked with measuring the process variable).  This ``paper trail'' created by As-Found and As-Left calibration tests allows us to measure how far the transmitter drifts over time.

If we never took ``As-Found'' readings, we would not know how far the transmitter drifted from its last calibration.  In other words, if all we ever saw in the documentation was the calibration data left {\it after} the technician calibrated the instrument to specifications, we would be led to think that all our transmitters were holding their calibrations perfectly well, whether or not they actually were.  Comparing the present ``As-Found'' data with the last ``As-Left'' data tells us how far the measuring device {\it drifted} over the calibration interval.

I know of one pharmaceuticals corporation which used this calibration data to judge the suitability of new transmitter models it was evaluating.  If the transmitter calibration drifted out of range (as evidenced by a significant difference between the last ``As-Left'' data and the present ``As-Found'' data), they would review the calibration tolerance and try it one more time over another maintenance interval.  If it failed the test once again, they got rid of the instrument and replaced it with another brand or model.

Analog electronic process transmitters typically have only two calibration adjustments: one for {\it zero} and another for {\it span}.  Occasionally you may find an analog electronic transmitter with a third adjustment: one for {\it linearity}.

Modern ``smart'' process transmitters have more components in need of adjustment.  A block diagram of a typical smart pressure transmitter shows this very clearly:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00090x01.eps}$$

The purpose of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is to translate the pressure sensor's electrical output signal into a digital number the microprocessor can understand.  Likewise, the purpose of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is to translate the digital output of the microprocessor into a 4 to 20 mA DC current signal representing measured pressure.  The procedure of calibrating the ADC is called a {\it sensor trim}, while the process of calibrating the DAC is called an {\it output trim}.

\vskip 10pt

Explain the importance of performing both a sensor trim and an output trim whenever calibrating a ``smart'' transmitter.  In other words, explain why it is not enough to simply program LRV and URV values into the microprocessor (e.g. LRV = 0 PSI ; URV = 30 PSI) and declare the job finished.

Furthermore, explain what external calibration equipment must be connected to the transmitter to complete a sensor trim procedure, and also what external calibration equipment must be connected in order to complete an output trim procedure.

\underbar{file i00090}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

Simply setting the LRV and URV values is not actually {\it calibrating} the transmitter to accurately correspond to reality.  If this concept is hard to grasp, imagine a transmitter whose LRV and URV values are set perfectly, and whose DAC is calibrated just right, but whose ADC suffers from a zero shift.  The microprocessor will ``think'' the pressure is something different from what it really is, and it will output an incorrect (zero-shifted) milliamp signal as a result.

\vskip 10pt

In order to perform a sensor trim, you must connect a known pressure source (a {\it standard}) to the transmitter's input port and correlate that standard pressure to the pressure value registered by the microprocessor.  When trimming the output, you must connect a precise milli-ammeter in series with the transmitter's output current to correlate the intended current signal of the microprocessor to the actual current.

\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 

While it is possible to compensate for zero and span shifts by skewing the LRV and URV parameters, this is not a good way to calibrate the transmitter.  This is especially true if the transmitter is supposed to have a nonlinear transfer function, as is the case with DP transmitters used to measure flow, or temperature transmitters configured to ``linearize'' the inherently nonlinear signal of a thermocouple.  With a nonlinear transfer function, zero and span shifts on the input do {\it not} correspond to equivalent zero and span shifts on the output!

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!

An important principle to bear in mind here is that the digital microprocessor inside the smart transmitter never makes arithmetic errors -- it {\it always} calculates the proper AO value for any given PV value.  Therefore, we should {\it always} expect the PV and AO figures displayed by the HART communicator to correspond perfectly with one another.

What will happen if there is a sensor trim error is that the transmitter will not ``see'' the real applied pressure: for any pressure applied to the sensor, the transmitter will register a PV value that is something different, and from there it will calculate what it thinks should be the correct milliamp output signal value.

If, however, there is an output (digital-to-analog converter) error, the transmitter will calculate the correct output signal value (AO) but this will not become the real milliamp current value output by the transmitter.

In summary, sensor trim errors cause the real input pressure to deviate from the PV value ``seen'' by the transmitter, while output trim errors cause the real current signal to deviate from the AO value calculated by the transmitter.  In no case will a trim error cause the PV and AO values to not correspond, because they are digitally calculated by the microprocessor which always performs perfect arithmetic.

\vskip 10pt

For more help understanding these concepts, refer to this simplified block diagram of a ``smart'' pressure transmitter with analog (4-20 mA) output:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03473x02.eps}$$

If the calibration error lies within the transmitter's sensor, then the analog output (AO) will read the same as the DMM and the process variable (PV) will deviate from the digital pressure gauge.  To predict the transmitter's PV and AO values, we set AO equal to the meter's indication (13.93 mA) and calculate what amount of sensed pressure would correspond to that amount of signal current.

\vskip 10pt

If the calibration error lies within the transmitter's output (DAC), then the analog output (AO) will deviate from the DMM and the process variable (PV) will read the same as the digital pressure gauge.  To predict the transmitter's PV and AO values, we set the PV equal to the pressure gauge's indication (37.80 "WC) and calculate what amount of output current would correspond to that amount of input pressure.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Does the new, requested range constitute a {\it zero} shift, a {\it span} shift, or both?  {\bf This is both a zero shift (LRV from 0 to 300) and a span shift (span from 400 to 75).}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} If this is a ``smart'' (digital) transmitter, does it need to be {\it re-trimmed} as well as {\it re-ranged}?  {\bf No.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Will the control room indicator PIR-89 need to be {\it re-calibrated}, {\it re-ranged}, or both? {\bf PIR-89 will need to be re-ranged as well, but not (necessarily) re-calibrated.  PIR-89 needs to display different pressure values for its 4-20 mA input, but presumably it is still capable of accurately interpreting 4 mA and 20 mA so no re-calibration is necessary.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Will the local pressure gauge PG-131 need to be {\it re-calibrated} as well?  {\bf No, because its operation is completely independent of PT-89 and PIR-89.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Will the pressure safety valves PSV-11, PSV-12, and/or PSV-13 need to be set for lower ``lift'' pressures? {\bf Again, no, because these valves' operation are independent of the pressure transmitter loop.  Safety valves are always rated by the pressure limits of the vessel(s), just as electrical fuses are rated by the current the wires can handle.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} If the maximum (factory) range of this pressure transmitter is 0 to 750 PSI and the maximum turndown ratio for the required accuracy is 20:1, will it be able to meet the new range?  If not, what might you have to do in order to fulfill operations' request? {\bf The turndown ratio of 20:1 means the minimum span can be set all the way down to 37.5 PSI.  Since operations is requesting a 75 PSI span, you should be alright.}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Why do you suppose operations would like you to re-range this transmitter?  In other words, what operational advantage(s) might be gained from doing so?  Are there any potential disadvantages of having the new range versus the old? {\bf Reducing the pressure measurement range results in the recorder's graphical display showing more detail (resolution) within the range of 300 to 375 PSI.  Pressure changes which would have formerly shown up as tiny wiggles in the trend may now be seen in far greater detail because the vertical axis of the trend has been essentially magnified by the span change.}

This question is a good candidate for a ``Virtual Troubleshooting'' exercise.  Presenting the diagram to students, you first imagine in your own mind a particular fault in the system.  Then, you present one or more symptoms of that fault (something noticeable by an operator or other user of the system).  Students then propose various diagnostic tests to perform on this system to identify the nature and location of the fault, as though they were technicians trying to troubleshoot the problem.  Your job is to tell them what the result(s) would be for each of the proposed diagnostic tests, documenting those results where all the students can see.

During and after the exercise, it is good to ask students follow-up questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What does the result of the last diagnostic test tell you about the fault?
\item{} Suppose the results of the last diagnostic test were different.  What then would that result tell you about the fault?
\item{} Is the last diagnostic test the best one we could do?
\item{} What would be the ideal order of tests, to diagnose the problem in as few steps as possible?

Suppose you are going to install a Rosemount model 1151 ``Alphaline'' (analog) differential pressure transmitter in a process, calibrated to a range of 0 to 100 inches W.C.  The transmitter's model number shows the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Model = {\it 1151DP}
\item{} Pressure range code = {\it 4}
\item{} Output code = {\it E}
\item{} Material code = {\it 22}
\end{itemize}

Answer the following questions regarding this transmitter as it applies to the application you intend to install it in:

\vskip 20pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Does this transmitter have sufficient turndown (``rangeability'') for the application?  Show your calculation to prove whether it does or not.

\vskip 50pt

\item{} Calculate the expected accuracy for this transmitter once installed, expressed in $\pm$ inches of water column.

\vskip 50pt

\item{} Calculate the six-month calibration stability of this transmitter after installation, expressed in $\pm$ inches of water column.

\vskip 50pt

\item{} Calculate the amount of total measurement error this transmitter may exhibit given an ambient temperature shift of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, expressed in $\pm$ inches of water column.

{\it Note: all performance data taken from pages 6-6 through 6-10 of the Rosemount manual (document 00809-0100-4360, Revision AA, copyright 1997).}

\vskip 10pt

The transmitter's {\bf 6:1} turndown ratio is more than adequate for the application.  Range code 4 gives an upper range limit (URL) of {\bf 150 "W.C.}, which when coupled with a turndown of 6:1 yields a minimum span of {\bf 25 "W.C.}, four times less than our intended span of 100 "W.C.

\vskip 10pt

Expected accuracy is $\pm$ 0.2\% of calibrated span, so the accuracy will be {\bf $\pm$ 0.2 "W.C.}

\vskip 10pt

Six-month stability is $\pm$ 0.2\% of URL, which is 150 "W.C. for this range code.  Thus, the six-month stability will be {\bf $\pm$ 0.3 "W.C.}

\vskip 10pt

Total error is $\pm$ (0.5\% of URL plus 0.5\% of calibrated span) per 100 degree Fahrenheit shift.  Thus, the total error for a 65 degree shift will be {\bf $\pm$ 0.8125 "W.C.}  It should be noted that the effect of temperature changes on pressure measurement (shown on page 6-7) is not the same as the effect of temperature on the LCD display's reading (shown on page 4-7).  This is a good lesson on the importance of {\it identifying context} when reading a technical document.  Just because you did a word-search and happened to find something that talks about temperature effect doesn't mean it's the same temperature effect you're interested in!  In this case, you had to read the previous page (4-6) to realize that the 0.01\% of range per degree C specified on page 4-7 isn't talking about pressure sensing at all, but rather the LCD unit option.

An instrument technician wants to create a temperature reference for a thermocouple transmitter by freezing some water, knowing that the freezing point of water at sea level is 32$^{o}$ F (or 0$^{o}$ C).  He inserts the thermocouple into a cup of water, then sets the cup and thermocouple inside a freezer until the water is frozen solid.  He then takes the cup out of the freezer and connects the thermocouple to the temperature transmitter for calibration.

What is wrong with the technician's procedure?  What must be done differently to ensure a reference temperature of 32$^{o}$ F (0$^{o}$ C) at the thermocouple tip?

What the technician needs is an ice-water {\it mixture} in order to guarantee stability at the freezing temperature.

\vskip 10pt

In lieu of setting a cup of water inside a freezer, I recommend dropping ice cubes into a cup of water, and stirring the mixture to achieve a uniform temperature.  Keep adding ice to make up for melting, and the mixture will remain at a constant 32$^{o}$ F (0$^{o}$ C) no matter what the ambient temperature of the room.

\notes{} 

That fact that this is a 12-bit ADC tells us all we need to know to calculate its maximum count value:

$$\hbox{Count}_{max} = 2^{12} - 1 = 4096 - 1 = 4095$$

Therefore, the count range is 0 to 4095 counts, matching the input voltage range of 0 to 5 volts, proportional.  Relating input voltage to count value is as simple as solving for this proportionality.  Each count is worth ${1 \over 4095}$ of 5 volts, or 1.221 mV.

\vskip 10pt

Performing calculations for the first table row, we take the given input voltage of 1.6 volts and solve for the percentage of range as well as the proportional count value:

$${1.6 \hbox{ V} \over 5 \hbox{ V}} = 32\% = {N \hbox{ counts} \over 4095 \hbox{ counts}}$$

$$N = 1310.4 \hbox{ counts}$$

Since there is no such thing as a non-integer count value, we may either round up (to 1311 counts) or round down (to 1310 counts).  The last step is simply converting the decimal values of 1310 and 1311 into hexadecimal.

A computer spreadsheet program may be used as a simulator for an analog-digital converter, taking an analog voltage signal value and converting it into a digital ``count'' value.  

Begin creating your own spreadsheet by following the format shown below, allowing anyone to enter an analog input value in volts, while the spreadsheet calculates the ``count'' value and displays it in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal formats.  Note that the yellow and blue shading in this example spreadsheet is strictly for aesthetic value (distinguishing input values from calculated values) and is not necessary for the spreadsheet to function:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04408x01.eps}$$

Converting percentage values into flow rates is easy: simply multiply each percentage by the maximum (URV) flow rate.

\vskip 10pt

Converting percentage values into differential pressure values is a little trickier.  Since the orifice plate is inherently nonlinear -- generating differential pressure proportional to the {\it square} of the flow rate -- we must take the percentage of flow and then square that percentage to arrive at a percentage of DP.  This new (squared) percentage value is then multiplied by the URV of the pressure range to calculate DP.

\vskip 10pt

The flow transmitter itself is linear, and so it simply takes the sensed DP and converts it linearly to a milliamp output signal.

\vskip 10pt

The square root ``extractor'' (relay) takes in the transmitter's milliamp signal, square-roots that signal percentage, then generates its own milliamp signal representing percentage of flow.  The end-result is that the relay's milliamp signal is linear to actual flow rate.

Suppose you are calibrating a panel-mounted indicator to be used for displaying flow rates, based on the signal coming from a (linear) DP transmitter sensing pressure across a venturi tube.  The DP transmitter is an analog electronic transmitter with a linear characteristic, which means the panel-mounted indicator must be configured for square-root characterization.

Calculate the ideal display value at the following input currents, assuming a calibrated range of 0 to 700 GPM for the indicator:

In instrumentation parlance, a {\it transducer} is a calibrated device used to convert one standardized signal into another standardized signal.  One very common form of transducer is an {\it I/P transducer}, which converts an electric current signal into a pneumatic pressure signal:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00084x01.eps}$$

The symbols shown above are standard for process and instrumentation diagrams (P\&ID's), where an electric cable is shown as a dashed line, a pneumatic pipe or tube shown as a line with double hash-marks periodically drawn through it, and the instrument is a circle with letters (in this case, ``Y'', representing a signal relay, computing element, transducer, or converter).

The most popular range for electric current signals is 4 to 20 mA DC.  The most common range for pneumatic (air pressure) signals is 3 to 15 PSI.  Therefore, the most common type of I/P transducer has an input range of 4-20 mA and an output range of 3-15 PSI.  Both of these ranges are there to represent some measured or manipulated quantity in an instrument system.  That is, 0\% of range will be represented by a 4 mA input signal to the I/P, and a 3 PSI output signal; 100\% of range will be represented by a 20 mA input signal and a 15 PSI output signal; 50\% range will be represented by a 12 mA input and a 9 PSI output.

Complete all the missing data in the following calibration table for this I/P transducer, and then describe how you were able to correlate the different percentages of range with specific current and pressure signal values:

Follow-up question: explain the procedure for starting with a current value in milliamps and calculating the equivalent percentage.

\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 

Here are the equations I used to arrive at my answers:

$$\hbox{current} = (16 \hbox{ mA}) \left( {\% \over 100}\right) + (4 \hbox{ mA})$$

$$\hbox{pressure} = (12 \hbox{ PSI}) \left( {\% \over 100}\right) + (3 \hbox{ PSI})$$

In general, to go from a percentage value to either current or pressure, take that percentage (as a decimal value between 0 and 1 inclusive) and multiply it by the {\it span} of the signal range, then add the live zero offset.

\vskip 10pt

Going from either a current value or a pressure value to a percentage is little more than the reverse of the above procedure.  Watch how I convert a current value of 16.8 milliamps into a percentage of range:

$$16.8 \hbox{ mA} - 4.0 \hbox{ mA} = 12.8 \hbox{ mA} \hskip 50pt \hbox{\it First, subtract the live-zero offset}$$

$${12.8 \hbox{ mA} \over 16.0 \hbox{ mA}} = 0.8 \hskip 50pt \hbox{\it Second, divide that number by the span}$$

$$0.8 \times 100\% = 80\% \hskip 50pt \hbox{\it Finally, convert this into a percentage}$$

These sorts of calculations are done quite often by instrument technicians as they troubleshoot instrument systems.  Imagine troubleshooting a 4-20 mA instrument circuit using an ammeter to measure current.  How do you correlate the measured current value into a percentage of range, and from that into an equivalent process measurement?  These calculations allow you to do this, which gives you a way to translate the current signals you measure with your meter into equivalent process values, without having to look at a pre-calibrated indicator.

Suppose you had a current-to-pressure (``I/P'') transducer with an output range of 3 to 15 PSI and an input range of 4 to 20 mA.  The following calibration table shows several input signal levels and their corresponding percentages of span and output pressures:

While the calculations for obtaining percent and output pressure (PSI) from input current (mA) values are not very complex, they can be tedious.  A powerful computer-based tool for relieving this tedium is a type of application called a {\it spreadsheet}.  A very common example of spreadsheet software is Microsoft {\it Excel} (although other spreadsheet programs exist, some of them free!).

A spreadsheet program presents a screen full of rectangular {\it cells} into which text, numerical values, and mathematical formulae may be entered.  Each cell is ``addressed'' by a system of row and column designators, traditionally numbers for rows and letters for columns (like the classic game of ``Battleship'' where coordinates on a grid-map are called out by letter and number combination) but a more modern convention designates both rows and columns by number.

We may set up a spreadsheet to calculate percentage values for this I/P based on input currents as follows.  The yellow and blue cell shading (color fill) shown in this example is entirely optional, but helps to distinguish number-entry fields from calculated-value fields (the number in the yellow cell {\tt R2C1} is the milliamp value you type in to the spreadsheet, while the number in the blue cell {\tt R2C3} is the PSI value calculated by the spreadsheet):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01626x01.eps}$$

What follows is a list of cell entries needed to create the spreadsheet display you see above:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\bf Cell R1C1:} {\tt Input (mA)}
\item{} {\bf Cell R2C1:} {\tt 6.88}
\item{} {\bf Cell R1C3:} {\tt Percent}
\item{} {\bf Cell R2C3:} {\tt = (R2C1 - 4) / 16} \hskip 10pt {\it (select ``\%'' display formatting)}
\end{itemize}

The text inside cells R1C1 and R1C3 is not essential for the spreadsheet to function -- like the color shading, they merely serve as labels to help describe what the number values mean.  The formula entered into cell R2C3 begins with an equals sign (=), which tells the spreadsheet to regard it as a formula rather than as text to be displayed verbatim as in R1C1 and R1C3.  Note how the formula references the numerical value located in the ``row 2 column 1'' cell by calling it ``R2C1''.  This allows the user to enter different values into cell R2C1, and the spreadsheet will automatically re-calculate the percentage for each entered mA value.  Thus, if you were to edit the contents of cell R2C1 to hold 12.8 instead of 6.88, the value shown in cell R2C3 would update to display 55.0 instead of 18.0 as it does now.

\vfil \eject

Your first task here is to start up a spreadsheet program and enter what is shown above, then validate the accuracy of your work by entering several different current (milliamp) values and checking that the percentages for each are calculated correctly by the spreadsheet.

Now that you have successfully created this spreadsheet, add the appropriate enteries into cells R1C5 and R2C5 so that it also calculates the appropriate output pressure for the I/P, for any arbitrary input current entered into cell R2C1.  When complete, your modified spreadsheet should look something like this:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i01626x02.eps}$$

Show what entries you had to place into cells R1C5 and R2C5 to make this spreadsheet work.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Identify the text character used to represent {\it division} in the formula shown in cell R2C3.  What is the appropriate character to represent {\it multiplication}?
\item{} Explain why parentheses are used in the formula in cell R2C3.  {\it Hint: a good problem-solving approach for answering this question is to analyze what would happen if the parentheses were not there!}
\item{} Explain what would happen if cell R2C3 were not configured to display in {\it percent}.
\item{} There is more than one correct formula to enter into cell R2C5 to properly calculate the output pressure in PSI.  One formula references the percentage value (located at R2C3), while the other formula references the milliamp value (located at R2C1).  Compare these two formulae, and explain which one makes more sense to you.
\item{} Explain how a spreadsheet is such a powerful mathematical tool for performing ``tedious'' calculations such as instrument input/output responses.  Can you think of any other practical uses for a spreadsheet?

Here are two possible formulae for entry into cell R2C5:

{\tt = ((R2C1 - 4) / 16) * 12 + 3}

\vskip 10pt

{\tt = R2C3 * 12 + 3}

A liquid storage vessel holding a very corrosive liquid has its level measured by a {\it bubbler} system, whereby a transmitter measures the backpressure of air inside a ``dip tube'' inserted into the vessel:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00249x01.eps}$$

Explain how this level measurement system works, and how it protects the DP cell from the corrosive effects of the process liquid.

Also, complete a calibration table for the differential pressure transmitter in this level measurement scenario, with a calibration tolerance of $\pm$ 0.5\%.  Assume that the lower range-value of the process (0\% level) is exactly the same height as the bottom of the dip tube:

Be sure to show all your mathematical work so that your instructor will be able to check the conceptual validity of your technique(s).  A good way to check to see if you're solving the problem correctly is to check that each and every one of your intermediate calculations (i.e. the results you get mid-way during the process to arrive at the final answer) has real physical meaning.  {\bf If you truly understand what you are doing, you will be able to identify the correct unit of measurement for every intermediate result and also be able to show where that number applies to the scenario at hand}.

The calibration error is a {\it zero} shift (the actual output consistently 0.3 mA greater than it should be), and it resides in the DAC.  Thus, the transmitter needs its output to be trimmed.

A tachogenerator is used to measure the rotary speed of a machine.  Its calibrated range is 0 to 1500 RPM (revolutions per minute) and its corresponding signal output is 0 to 10 volts DC.  Given these range values, calculate the output voltages for the following input shaft speeds, and then describe how you were able to correlate the different speeds to output voltage values:

\notes{} 

This sort of problem may be solved using simple proportions.  We know that the voltage output by a tachogenerator will be directly proportional to shaft speed.  In other words, doubling the shaft speed doubles the voltage.  This makes the math very simple.

All we have to do is determine what percentage of full speed (1500 RPM) our given speed is, and then multiply the full-speed voltage (10 volts) by that percentage.

We may express the relationship between shaft speed ($S$) and voltage ($V$) as a proportionality:

$$S \propto V$$

We may express this relationship a little more precisely by inserting a {\it constant of proportionality} ($k$) and changing the proportional symbol to an equality:

$$S = kV$$

Now, all we need to do is solve for $k$ using a pair of simultaneous values for $S$ and $V$.  Since we were told the output of the tachogenerator is 10 volts at 1500 RPM:

$$1500 = k 10$$

$$k = 150$$

Knowing that $k$ = 150 for this tachogenerator (with $S$ in units of RPM and $V$ in units of volts) allows us to solve for any speed given any voltage by way of simple multiplication:

$$S = 150 V$$

If the tachogenerator drives a voltmeter, we could even post this $k$ value on the face of the meter so that an operator could multiply the voltage measurement by 150 to obtain shaft speed in RPM.

\vskip 10pt

Another way to think about this sort of problem is to use a technique I call ``unity fractions.''  Since we know tachogenerator speed and voltage to be proportional to one another, and we know they share the same zero point (0 RPM = 0 volts), we may form a fraction out of the equality 1500 RPM = 10 volts and use it in such a way as to cancel the unit of RPM and replace it with volts.  

We know that any fraction where the numerator and denominator are the same quantity ($5 \over 5$ for example) has a value of 1, or unity.  We also know that multiplying any value by 1 does not change that value (for example, $570 \times 1 = 570$).  So, if we form a fraction out of two {\it physically equal} quantities -- in this case, the fraction 10 volts divided by 1500 RPM, since those two quantities are physically equal to one another in the context of the tachogenerator -- this ``unity fraction'' has a {\it physical} value of 1, and we may safely multiply it by any other value without changing that other value's quantity.  The point of doing this is to cancel out the unwanted unit and replace it with another unit.

To see how this works, let's use this technique to calculate tachogenerator voltage at 1230 RPM:

$$\left({1230 \hbox{ RPM} \over 1} \right)  \left( {10 \hbox{ volts} \over 1500 \hbox{ RPM}} \right) = 8.2 \hbox{ volts}$$

The unit of ``RPM'' cancels from the top of the left-hand fraction and the bottom of the right-hand fraction, leaving the unit of ``volts'' as the only one remaining.  Since the unity fraction of $10 \hbox{ volts} \over 1500 \hbox{ RPM}$ has a physical value of 1, multiplying it by the fraction $1230 \hbox{ RPM} \over 1$ does not alter that value.  We only cancel out the unit of RPM, to tell us how many volts the tachogenerator will output at that speed.

We can use this same ``unity fraction'' to translate from volts to RPM, too!  Imagine a situation where the tachogenerator was spinning fast enough to output a voltage of 7.1 volts.  How fast is this?  We can use this same unit-cancellation technique to find out:

$$\left({7.1 \hbox{ volts} \over 1} \right)  \left( 1500 \hbox{ RPM} \over {10 \hbox{ volts}} \right) = 1065 \hbox{ RPM}$$

Since the unity fraction of $10 \hbox{ volts} \over 1500 \hbox{ RPM}$ has a physical value of 1, we may flip it upside-down without changing its value ($5 \over 5$ is still 1, whether you flip the fraction upside-down or not!).  In this case, we needed to flip the unity fraction upside-down in order to make the unit of ``volts'' cancel out and leave us with the unit of ``RPM'' as the only one left standing.

\vskip 10pt

While the technique of ``unity fractions'' may seem over-complicated, especially for a simple proportion problem like this one, it is very powerful.  We will find lots of application for this technique later on in our studies!

A turbine flowmeter measuring cooling water for a large power generator uses an electronic circuit to convert its pickup coil pulses into a 4-20 mA analog current signal.  The ``K factor'' for the turbine element is 0.0101 liter per pulse, and the 4-20 mA analog output is ranged from 0 to 500 l/m flow.  Complete the following table of values for this transmitter, assuming perfect calibration (no error).  Be sure to show your work!

An important part of performing instrument calibration is determining the extent of an instrument's error.  Error is usually measured in {\it percent of span}.  Calculate the percent of span error for each of the following examples, and be sure to note the sign of the error (positive or negative):

\begin{itemize}
\item{} {\bf Pressure gauge}
\item{} LRV = 0 PSI
\item{} URV = 100 PSI 
\item{} Test pressure = 65 PSI

\item{} Test buffer solution = 7.04 pH
\item{} Instrument indication = 7.13 pH
\item{} Error = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \% of span
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Also, show the math you used to calculate each of the error percentages.

\vskip 10pt

Here is the equation I used to calculate percentage error in each case:

$$\hbox{\% error} = \left({\hbox{Actual} - \hbox{Ideal} \over \hbox{Span}}\right) (100 \%)$$

Remember that the mathematical {\it sign} of the error is very important to note!  Both the weigh scale and the thermometer have {\it negative} error values because their indications fell below the test (ideal) values.

A positive error value means the instrument registers too much, while a negative error value means the instrument registers too little.

Suppose you are going to install a Rosemount model 1151 ``Alphaline'' (analog) differential pressure transmitter in a process, calibrated to a range of 0 to 100 inches W.C.  The transmitter's model number shows the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Model = {\it 1151DP}
\item{} Pressure range code = {\it 4}
\item{} Output code = {\it E}
\item{} Material code = {\it 22}
\end{itemize}

Answer the following questions regarding this transmitter as it applies to the application you intend to install it in:

\vskip 20pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Does this transmitter have sufficient turndown (``rangeability'') for the application?  Show your calculation to prove whether it does or not.

\item{} Calculate the expected accuracy for this transmitter once installed, expressed in $\pm$ inches of water column.

\vskip 50pt

\item{} Calculate the six-month calibration stability of this transmitter after installation, expressed in $\pm$ inches of water column.

\vskip 10pt

The transmitter's {\bf 6:1} turndown ratio is more than adequate for the application.  Range code 4 gives an upper range limit (URL) of {\bf 150 "W.C.}, which when coupled with a turndown of 6:1 yields a minimum span of {\bf 25 "W.C.}, four times less than our intended span of 100 "W.C.

\vskip 10pt

Expected accuracy is $\pm$ 0.2\% of calibrated span, so the accuracy will be {\bf $\pm$ 0.2 "W.C.}

\vskip 10pt

Six-month stability is $\pm$ 0.2\% of URL, which is 150 "W.C. for this range code.  Thus, the six-month stability will be {\bf $\pm$ 0.3 "W.C.}

\vskip 10pt

Total error is $\pm$ (0.5\% of URL plus 0.5\% of calibrated span) per 100 degree Fahrenheit shift.  Thus, the total error for a 65 degree shift will be {\bf $\pm$ 0.8125 "W.C.}  It should be noted that the effect of temperature changes on pressure measurement (shown on page 6-7) is not the same as the effect of temperature on the LCD display's reading (shown on page 4-7).  This is a good lesson on the importance of {\it identifying context} when reading a technical document.  Just because you did a word-search and happened to find something that talks about temperature effect doesn't mean it's the same temperature effect you're interested in!  In this case, you had to read the previous page (4-6) to realize that the 0.01\% of range per degree C specified on page 4-7 isn't talking about pressure sensing at all, but rather the LCD unit option.

A pressure calibration device called a {\it deadweight tester} generates very precise pressures by means of calibrated weights placed on top of a hydraulic piston:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00153x01.eps}$$

The secondary piston is moved in and out by turning a handle on a threaded rod.  Its sole purpose is to displace enough oil to force the primary piston to rise from its resting position, so that it is entirely suspended by oil pressure.  In that condition, the gauge will be subject to whatever pressure is proportional to the weights placed on top of the primary piston, and the area of the primary piston.

What will happen to the gauge's indication if the secondary piston is pushed in further?  What will happen to the gauge's indication if the secondary piston is pulled out, but not so far that the primary piston comes down to its resting position?  In other words, what effect does the secondary piston {\it position} have on pressure applied to the gauge?

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00153x02.eps}$$

\vskip 20pt \vbox{\hrule \hbox{\strut \vrule{} {\bf Suggestions for Socratic discussion} \vrule} \hrule}

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Why are deadweight testers considered accurate {\it standards} for fluid pressure?  What is it about their design and operation that makes them so accurate?  Conversely, what aspects of their construction would have to change in order to corrupt their inherent accuracy?
\item{} If a technician changes the type of fluid used in a deadweight tester (for example, from one type of oil to another), will its accuracy change?
\item{} Identify some potential problems one might encounter when using a deadweight tester.  What things, specifically, do you see that could go wrong with this device?
\end{itemize}

\underbar{file i00153}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

Ideally, the secondary piston's position will have {\it no effect} on the oil pressure sent to the gauge.  Consequently, the gauge indication should not change.

\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 

So long as the primary piston is completely suspended by oil pressure, the oil pressure {\it must} be equal to the force created by the weights (which does not change) divided by the area of the primary piston (which also does not change).  All the secondary piston does is displace oil to make the primary piston rise or fall.  It cannot ``miscalibrate'' the output of the tester, so long as the primary piston is kept suspended by oil and is not resting on anything that would take some of the weight and thus relieve the oil of any pressure.  Another way of saying this is that the output pressure of a deadweight tester is either spot-on or way off, and it is easy to tell when the pressure is not correct.

Practically, to check for primary piston binding, the primary piston is gently rotated as the secondary piston is pushed in.  When the primary piston is completely suspended by oil, it should rotate freely, the mass of the calibrating weights ensuring a long ``coasting'' time.  Slow rotation of the primary piston will overcome static friction, and allows the piston to settle in the position where it is most free.

I strongly recommend you bring an actual deadweight tester to class for live demonstration, preferably with a pressure gauge attached.  

\vskip 10pt

A common misconception among students is that a deadweight tester measures pressure.  Not so!  A deadweight tester {\it generates} precisely accurate pressures to use for calibrating {\it other} measuring instruments.

Answer the following four questions about deadweight testers:


\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(1) What is it about the nature of a deadweight tester that makes it so accurate and repeatable?  To phrase this question in the negative, what would have to change in order to affect the accuracy of a deadweight tester's output pressure?

\par} \vskip 10pt




\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(2) Why is it important for a deadweight tester to be {\it level} while it is being used to calibrate a pressure instrument?

\par} \vskip 10pt



\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(3) What effect will trapped air have inside a deadweight tester?

\par} \vskip 10pt




\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(4) Why is it advisable to {\it gently} spin the primary piston and weights while the piston is suspended by oil pressure?

\par} \vskip 10pt



\underbar{file i00154}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(1) The accuracy of a deadweight tester is fixed by three fundamental variables, all of which are quite constant, two of which can be manufactured to highly accurate specifications, and the third being a constant of nature:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} The mass of the calibration weights
\item{} The area of the primary piston
\item{} The gravity of the Earth
\end{itemize}

\par} \vskip 10pt




\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(2) If a deadweight is not level, the force generated by the precision weights will not be parallel to the primary piston's axis of travel, meaning that the piston will not support their full weight.

\par} \vskip 10pt




\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(3) Entrapped air will make the piston's motion ``springy'' rather than solid and secure.

\par} \vskip 10pt




\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(4) Spinning the primary piston eliminates static friction, leaving only dynamic friction (which is much less) to interfere with gravity's force on the primary piston.

\par} \vskip 10pt



\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 


\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(2) If a deadweight is not level, the force generated by the precision weights will not be parallel to the primary piston's axis of travel, meaning that the piston will ``see'' less force than it should.  Imagine an object parked on an incline, and note how the force perpendicular to the incline's face is {\it less} than the vertical force (weight) of the object.  In the case of the deadweight tester, this will result in a pressure that is erroneously low.

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
Also, this will result in some amount of lateral force being applied to the piston rod bushing, resulting in friction that may similarly diminish the pressure generated.

\par} \vskip 10pt






\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

\noindent
(4) It should be mentioned that {\it gentle} spinning is all that is needed for the primary piston to overcome static friction.  Some students have the tendency to spin the weights as though they were a potter's wheel!

Two flow-indicating instruments employ a common orifice plate to measure the flow of water through a pipe.  The full differential pressure generated by this orifice plate at its rated flow of 800 GPM is 120 inches water column (120 "WC):

\vskip 10pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Receiver gauge (3-15 PSI input) connected to the output of a pneumatic DP transmitter connected across the orifice, registering 385 GPM on a 0-800 GPM square-root scale
\vskip 10pt
\item{} Panel-mounted indicator (3-15 PSI) connected to the output of the same pneumatic DP transmitter, registering 403 GPM on a 0-800 GPM square-root scale
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Based on this information, where do you think the calibration error is located?  If there isn't enough information yet to pinpoint the location of the error, devise a test to reveal where the error is.

\underbar{file i00733}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

We cannot tell exactly where the problem is, but we know it must be either in the receiver gauge or in the panel-mounted indicator (assuming only one fault in the system).

\vskip 10pt

One test would be to block and equalize the DP transmitter's manifold, to see which indicator goes closest to zero.  Chances are, the error is (at least) a zero shift, and as such should reveal itself in this test.  Whichever indicator goes exactly to zero during this test is good; whichever one reads some non-zero value during this test is in error.

\vskip 10pt

Another test would be to use a pressure gauge to measure the 3-15 PSI pneumatic signal coming from the transmitter.  If the pressure is 5.78 PSI, the receiver gauge is good and the panel-mounted indicator must be in error.  If the pressure is 6.05 PSI, the receiver gauge is in error and the panel-mounted indicator is good.
