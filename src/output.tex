Brytere, om de er operert for hånd, en aktuator eller en fysiks prosess, kommer i to varianter: \textit{normwlt åpen} og \textit{normalt lukket}. Du er sikkert vandt til å se begge typer i skjemaer. 

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02966x01.eps}$$

\textit{Normalt åpne brytere} lukker (slepper strøm i gjennom) når de aktiveres. Når de deaktiveres, går tilbake til utgangposisjonen eller normalposisjonen. 

\textit{Normalt-lukkede brytere} er helt motsatt: de åpner (stopper strømmen) når de aktiveres og går tilbake til lukket (normal) posisjon nå de deaktiveres. 

\vskip 10pt

Definer "normalposisjonen" for disse bryterene. Med andre ord forklar hvilken prosess egenskap som må til for å holde den i normalposisjon og hva som  aktiverer den.

The ``normal'' condition for a process switch is the condition of {\it least stimulus}.  For example:

\vskip 10pt

\begin{itemize}
\item{} A pressure switch will be in its ``normal'' state when there is {\it minimum pressure applied}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} A level switch will be in its ``normal'' state when there is {\it no level detected by the switch}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} A temperature switch will be in its ``normal'' state when it is {\it cold}
\vskip 10pt
\item{} A flow switch will be in its ``normal'' state when there is {\it no flow detected by the switch}
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 

The ``normal'' status of an electrical switch, as universally defined by manufacturers, is a condition of:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} minimum stimulus
\item{} rest
\item{} a ``low'' sensing condition
\end{itemize}

Normally-Open (NO) contacts are sometimes called {\it form-A} contacts.

\vskip 10pt

Normally-Closed (NC) contacts are sometimes called {\it form-B} contacts.

\vskip 10pt

A switch having both NO and NC contacts is sometimes called {\it form-C}.

Endebrytere er elektriske brytere som er laget slik at de aktueres ved bevegelse eller posisjon til et objekt, istedenfor at et menneske skal trykke inn en knapp. Enkle endebrytere bruker direkte fysisk kontakt med en arm, og av og til en rulle på enden for lav friksjon.

En forbedring i forhold til endebrytere med fysisk kontakt kan i mange tilfeller være induktive nærhetssensorer. Denne type bryter aktiveres ved at et objekt kommer nærme den. Det er ikke nødvendig med fysisk kontakt. Forklar hvordan denne type bryter virker, og hvilke materialer den kan detektere. 

Induktive nærhetssensorer trenger driftsspenning. Det er vanlig med +24V DC. Utgangen er normalt ikke en potensialfri kontakt, men en transistor.

Remember, the ``normal'' status of a switch is that state the switch is in when there is a {\it lack} of stimulus!  Therefore, a normally-closed flow switch will be closed when there is {\it no flow} going through it.

\item{} PSL = Pressure Switch, Low
\item{} PSH = Pressure Switch, High
\item{} PSHH = Pressure Switch, High-High
\end{itemize}

Both warning lamps should be off when the steam pressure is between 80 and 200 PSI.  The boiler will automatically shut down when the shutdown solenoid de-energizes, and this will happen if the steam pressure exceeds 220 PSI for at least 10 seconds.

\vskip 10pt

The difference between a ``normally open'' process switch and a ``normally closed'' process switch is vitally important for technicians to understand.  The ``normal'' condition referred to in each label does {\it not} mean the condition that is typical for the process.  Rather, it refers to a condition where the switch is subjected to {\it minimum stimulus}.  In other words, the ``normal'' condition for each switch is:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Temperature switch = cold
\item{} Pressure switch = low or no pressure
\item{} Level switch = empty vessel
\item{} Flow switch = low or no flow
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 

Time-delay relay contacts always have an ``arrowhead'' symbol {\it pointing in the direction of timing}.  In this case, the time-delay contact is normally-open, with the arrow pointing in the direction of open.  Thus, this contact will close immediately when coil TD1 is energized, but will delay 10 seconds before opening when coil TD1 is de-energized.

Explain the operating principles of these valve actuator types, then answer the questions that follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item{}Spring-and-diaphragm (pneumatic)
\item{}Piston (pneumatic)
\item{}Electromechanical (electric motor)
\item{}Electromagnetic (electric solenoid)
\item{}Electrohydraulic
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

Excluding the solenoid style of valve actuator, which is not used for proportioning control, which actuator type listed here is the simplest?

\vskip 10pt

Which of the actuators listed here inherently hold their position under a loss of electric power or compressed air supply?

\vskip 10pt

Which of the actuators listed here inherently ``fail'' in one direction (either full-open or full-closed) under a loss-of-supply condition, or else may be modified to do so?

\underbar{file i00781}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

Spring-and-diaphragm pneumatic actuators work by allowing pressurized air to push against a large, flexible diaphragm.  The force created by the air pressure against the diaphragm's surface area works in opposition to the force produced by a compressed spring.  The spring's compression must change to balance out new levels of air pressure, and this results in a change in position which is then used to move a valve mechanism.

\vskip 10pt

Pneumatic piston actuators use a piston instead of a flexible diaphragm for compressed air to push against.  Some piston actuators have springs to provide a ``return'' force (air pushes the piston one way, and the spring pushes it back), while other piston actuators are double-acting (compressed air on both sides of the piston).

\vskip 10pt

Electromechanical actuators use an electric motor coupled to the valve stem or shaft via a gear mechanism.  As the motor turns, the valve changes position.  Often used for on-off control of valves (from full-open to full-closed and back), electric actuators may also be equipped with position sensors and servo drive electronics for proportioning control.

\vskip 10pt

Solenoid (electromagnetic) valve actuators are simple open-closed devices, not used for throttling.  They utilize an electromagnet coil to magnetically attract an armature, sometimes in opposition to a spring force.

\vskip 10pt

Electrohydraulic actuators usually use an electric motor to turn a hydraulic pump, the fluid output of which moves a piston actuator.

\vskip 10pt

Electromechanical actuators (where the valve is moved by the turning of an electric motor) inherently hold their positions under a loss-of-supply condition, as well as electrohydraulic actuators (where the valve is moved by a piston actuated by hydraulic pressure from a pump turned by an electric motor).

\vskip 10pt

Any actuator with a return spring will inherently ``fail'' to a consistent position under a loss-of-supply condition.  This includes pneumatic diaphragm and piston actuators, and solenoid actuators.

\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\notes{} 

Pneumatic spring-and-diaphragm actuators tend to be much simpler than any sort of actuator using electric motors.  Pneumatic piston actuators often require a special device called a {\it positioner} to convert an air pressure signal into a definite piston position, because of friction effects of the piston inside the cylinder.  With a diaphragm, however, actuator motion is a direct function of applied air pressure.

This is not to say that pneumatic piston actuators {\it cannot} function without a positioner.  However, the fact that many cannot places the diaphragm class of pneumatic actuator above the piston in terms of design simplicity.

\vskip 10pt

Pneumatic actuators, if of the spring-return variety, tend to move to one extreme position (``fail-closed'' or ``fail-open'') if air supply is lost.  Double-acting piston actuators, though, will stop moving under a loss of air pressure, but they may not rigidly hold their positions against force from the valve trim.  Spring-return actuators may be modified for ``hold-position'' behavior with the addition of a ``locking valve'' that isolates the diaphragm chamber when supply air pressure is lost.

\vskip 10pt

Electrohydraulic actuators may be modified to fail in a consistent direction if power is lost, by providing a return spring in the hydraulic cylinder and a fail-open solenoid valve to equalize the cylinder under loss of power.

%In each of these process control examples, the transmitter produces an increasing signal for an increase in process measurement (level, pressure, temperature, etc.), and the I/P transducer produces an increasing air pressure signal out for an increasing current signal in.  

Din oppgave er å avgjøre om regulatoren skal ha \textit{direkte} eller \textit{reverserende} virkning. 

%Your task is to determine the proper action for the process controller, either {\it direct-acting} or {\it reverse-acting}.  Remember, a direct-acting controller produces an increasing output signal with an increasing process variable input.  A reverse-acting controller produces a decreasing output signal for an increasing process variable input.  It is essential for stability that the controller have the correct direction of action!

A technique I find very helpful in analyzing these types of problems is to draw small ``up'' and ``down'' arrows next to each signal line to represent which way the signal will go or ought to go (increase or decrease) for a given process change (usually I assume an increase in process measurement).  You may also use the words ``more'' and ``less'' if the arrows become confusing.

\vskip 10pt

A problem-solving technique you can have your students try in class is to perform a ``thought experiment'' on each scenario, assuming direct controller action.  Analyze what the system would do with a direct-acting controller and a rising PV signal, then see if the valve action makes sense (i.e. would bring the system back to setpoint) or not.  If it makes sense, then we need direct controller action.  If it doesn't make sense, then we need reverse controller action.

In this biogas generation system, cow manure is used as a feedstock to produce methane gas (CH$_{4}$), which is then used to fuel an engine to turn a generator and make electricity.  The waste heat from the engine is used to maintain the cascaded digesters (``reactors'' R-101 and R-102) at optimal temperatures for anaerobic bacteria to digest the manure and produce biogas (approximately 105 $^{o}$F):

\notes{} 

TV-41 and TV-48 are both {\it 3-way} or {\it diverter} valves, sometimes called {\it mixing} valves if used to bring two streams together.  In this case, they both serve to divert engine coolant flow around heat exchangers to control temperature.

\vskip 10pt

Control valves LV-55a and LV-55b must be {\it complementarily} split-ranged, because we need the two to act in harmony to divert flow out of reactor R-101 to either R-102 or back through the heat exchanger and into R-101 again.  At no time do we ever wish to close off both of these valves, because that would cause the pump discharging material from R-101 to become ``dead-headed'' (i.e. pumping into a blocked line).  Given that LIC-55 is reverse-acting, a high liquid level inside of R-101 will produce a low controller output, which is the condition where we desire LV-55a to be open further than LV-55b.  Thus, LV-55a needs to be wide-open at 4 mA (signal-to-close, fail-open) and LV-55b needs to be wide open at 20 mA (signal-to-open, fail-closed):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00069x02.eps}$$

\begin{itemize}
\item{} LV-55a (flow out to R-102): 4 mA = wide open ; 20 mA = shut
\item{} LV-55b (R-101 recirculation): 4 mA = shut ; 20 mA = wide open
\end{itemize}

\vskip 10pt

If TT-43 failed high, TIC-43 would ``think'' the engine was too hot, and run the fin-fan speed at maximum all the time.  The result of this would be the engine running too cool, and possibly the digesters (R-101 and R-102) running too cool as well, causing biogas production to decrease.

In this system a loop controller receives a process variable signal from a 2-wire (loop-powered) transmitter, and sends its own 4-20 mA control signal to operate a control valve.  A data acquisition unit (DAQ) performs the auxiliary function of monitoring the process variable signal (voltage dropped across the loop resistor) and reporting it over a digital network where it is recorded on the hard drive of a personal computer.  If it helps, you may think of a DAQ as being nothing more than a multi-channel voltmeter, sensing voltage between each of its input terminals ({\tt In\_1}, {\tt In\_2}) and its ``common'' ({\tt Com}) terminal:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02557x01.eps}$$

Unfortunately, the DAQ not only registers the DC signal value, but also any HART pulses present in the transmitter circuit whenever a technician connects a HART communicator to the transmitter to do any maintenance work.  The operators are annoyed by the misleading ``noise'' on the DAQ-recorded signal whenever a technician does routine work on that transmitter, and so they come to you asking for a solution.

\vskip 10pt
 
Devise a simple modification to this circuit that will eliminiate (or at least minimize) the ``HART noise'' seen by the DAQ without impeding its ability to record normal process variable signal values.

Draw your own sketch showing how the given information in this problem inter-relates, and use this sketch to explain your solution.
\item{} A useful analytical technique for any DC electric circuit is to identify all electrical sources and loads in the circuit, annotate the diagram with arrowheads showing the directions of all currents, and also with ``+'' and ``$-$'' symbols (and/or curved arrows) showing the polarities of all component voltages.  Show how this helps you analyze the circuit shown in this question.

A simple resistor-capacitor low-pass filter connected between the resistor and the DAQ channel will suffice:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02557x02.eps}$$

The values of $R$ and $C$ should be chosen to create a cutoff frequency lower than the lowest frequency expected with HART (1200 Hz), but not so low that relevant changes in the process variable would be excessively damped.

\vskip 10pt

Beware of any solutions that would shunt HART signals around the 250 ohm loop resistance, such as a capacitor connected in parallel with DAQ input!  This would solve the HART interference problem, but at the cost of impeding all HART communication!

This PLC is being used to start and stop an electric motor, and also to shut it down automatically if any of three ``shutdown'' conditions occur:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Excessive vibration
\item{} Overcurrent (overload heater contact)
\item{} High winding temperature
\end{itemize}

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03847x01.eps}$$

The status of each shutdown contact is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Vibration contact: {\it closed} when okay, {\it opens} when vibration becomes excessive
\item{} Overload contact: {\it closed} when okay, {\it opens} when overloaded
\item{} Temperature contact: {\it open} when okay, {\it closes} when hot
\end{itemize}

Draw a PLC ladder-logic program to start and stop this motor.  Be sure to make the program latching so that the operator does not have to hold the Start button to keep the motor running.

The following PLC program was written to control the operation of a large electric motor-driven pump.  A variety of ``permissive'' inputs protect the pump from damage under abnormal conditions:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02560x01.eps}$$

Identify the type of contact (either NO or NC) necessary for each of these electrical switch contacts, based on the trip condition (either {\it high} or {\it low}) and how each input is applied in the PLC program:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Start pushbutton = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} Stop pushbutton = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} High vibration = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} Low inlet pressure = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} High outlet pressure = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} High motor temperature = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} High pump temperature = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\end{itemize}

\svar{} 

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Start pushbutton = {\bf NO} 
\item{} Stop pushbutton = {\bf NO} 
\item{} High vibration = {\bf NC} 
\item{} Low inlet pressure = {\bf NO} 
\item{} High outlet pressure = {\bf NO} 
\item{} High motor temperature = {\bf NC} 
\item{} High pump temperature = {\bf NO} 
\end{itemize}

A helpful problem-solving technique is to first identify the necessary {\it coloring} which will allow the motor to run (i.e. the condition of all permissives during correct operating conditions):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02560x02.eps}$$

We know the NO contact instruction labeled ``Permissive'' in the upper rung needs to be colored if ever the ``Motor'' coil instruction is to receive color.  This means the entire series string of contact instructions in the second rung needs to be colored under proper operating conditions.

\vskip 10pt

Once we know this, we may determing the necessary ``normal'' statuses of all permissive switches in order to make their corresponding PLC program contact instructions colored.  A few examples will be given here:

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf High vibration:} The PLC contact instruction for this permissive is normally-open, which means that PLC input must be energized with electricity in order to color that contact instruction.  This means the high vibration switch must be in the closed condition while everything is running as it should (i.e. low vibration), and open if vibration becomes excessive.  A vibration switch that is closed when vibration is below the trip threshold is a {\bf normally-closed (NC)} vibration switch.

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf Low inlet pressure:} The PLC contact instruction for this permissive is normally-open, which means that PLC input must be energized with electricity in order to color that contact instruction.  This means the low inlet pressure switch must be in the closed condition while everything is running as it should (i.e. adequate inlet pressure), and open if inlet pressure becomes too low.  A pressure switch that is open when pressure is below the trip threshold is a {\bf normally-open (NO)} pressure switch.

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf High outlet pressure:} The PLC contact instruction for this permissive is normally-closed, which means that PLC input must be de-energized in order to color that contact instruction.  This means the high outlet pressure switch must be in the open condition while everything is running as it should (i.e. moderate outlet pressure), and close if outlet pressure becomes excessive.  A pressure switch that is open when pressure is below the trip threshold is a {\bf normally-open (NO)} pressure switch.

The following PLC program was written to control the operation of a large electric motor-driven pump.  A variety of ``permissive'' inputs protect the pump from damage under abnormal conditions, and one permissive in particular (``valve open'') will only allow the pump to start up if one of the valves in the piping system is in the full-open position:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02561x01.eps}$$

Identify the type of contact (either NO or NC) necessary for each of these electrical switch contacts, based on the trip condition (either {\it high} or {\it low}) and how each input is applied in the PLC program:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Start pushbutton = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} Throttling valve open limit = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} Stop pushbutton = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} High bearing temperature = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} High vibration = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} High motor temperature = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\item{} Low oil pressure = {\it NO} or {\it NC}? 
\end{itemize}

\underbar{file i02561}

\svar{} 

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Start pushbutton = {\bf NO}
\item{} Throttling valve open limit = {\bf NC}
\item{} Stop pushbutton = {\bf NO}
\item{} High bearing temperature = {\bf NO}
\item{} High vibration = {\bf NC}
\item{} High motor temperature = {\bf NO}
\item{} Low oil pressure = {\bf NO}
\end{itemize}

A helpful problem-solving technique is to first identify the necessary {\it coloring} which will allow the motor to start up and keep running (i.e. the condition of all permissives during correct operating conditions):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i02561x02.eps}$$

Since the motor is controlled by retentive coil instructions (``Set'' and ``Reset''), we know all the permissive contacts on the Reset rung must be uncolored in order for the motor to run.  The normally-closed ``Valve open'' instruction must be colored in order to allow the Start input to latch the Set coil and start the motor.

\vskip 10pt

Once we know this, we may determing the necessary ``normal'' statuses of all permissive switches in order to make their corresponding PLC program contact instructions colored.  A few examples will be given here:

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf ``Valve open'' limit switch:} The PLC contact instruction for this permissive is normally-closed, which means that PLC input must be de-energized in order to color that contact instruction.  This means the limit switch must be in the open condition when the valve mechanism moves into the switch's sensing range (in the fully-open position), and close when the valve mechanism moves away from the switch.  A limit switch that is closed with nothing near it is a {\bf normally-closed (NC)} limit switch.
\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf Low oil pressure:} The PLC contact instruction for this permissive is normally-closed, which means that PLC input must be energized with electricity in order to maintain that contact instruction in an uncolored state.  This means the low oil pressure switch must be in the closed condition while everything is running as it should (i.e. adequate oil pressure), and open if oil pressure becomes too low.  A pressure switch that is open when pressure is below the trip threshold is a {\bf normally-open (NO)} pressure switch.

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf High bearing temperature:} The PLC contact instruction for this permissive is normally-open, which means that PLC input must be de-energized in order to maintain that contact instruction in an uncolored state.  This means the high bearing temperature switch must be in the open condition while everything is running as it should (i.e. low bearing temperature), and close if temperature becomes excessive.  A temperature switch that is open when temperature is below the trip threshold is a {\bf normally-open (NO)} temperature switch.

A Koyo CLICK PLC controls the start-up of a gas-fuel furnace, using an {\it event drum} instruction.  The purpose of this sequence is to safely ``purge'' the furnace of any residual fuel gas vapors using fresh air before attempting to ignite it:

Timer T1 controls the purge cycle (480 seconds = 8 minutes).

\vskip 10pt

Timer T2 controls the ``wait'' time, allowing time between purge completion and burner start.  The drum will reset to step 1 if no one has pushed the ``Ignition start'' button within 5 minutes of purge completion.

\vskip 10pt

Timer T3 controls the ignition time delay (10 seconds), giving that much time for the burner to light.  If there is no proof of flame within this amount of time, the drum will reset to step 1.

\vskip 10pt

Finally, someone pressing the ``Shutdown'' button will reset the drum to setp 1.

A vessel holding some process liquid needs to have its level monitored.  The range of level in this vessel is 0 to 20 feet, and the process liquid has a specific gravity of 1.0 (like water).  Someone decides to attach a pressure transmitter to the bottom of the vessel to infer level from hydrostatic pressure like this:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00248x01.eps}$$

Later, a top is added to this vessel to keep rain from entering in.  Unfortunately, though, this process liquid tends to emit vapor which will be trapped by the closed vessel and create a pressure inside of it.  A small vent is added to the top of the vessel to permit the vapor to escape, but it is a {\it small} vent, not big enough to ensure a total absence of vapor pressure buildup at all times:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00248x02.eps}$$

What problem in level measurement will result from there being an occasional vapor pressure buildup inside this vessel?  How may this problem be corrected so that the liquid level will be accurately measured at all times?

\underbar{file i00248}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

Any vapor pressure will be sensed by the transmitter and interpreted as increased liquid level!

\vskip 10pt

Two solutions to this problem: 

\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

(1) Use two transmitters (one at top of vessel, one at bottom) and electronically subtract their output signals.

\par} \vskip 10pt



\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

(2) Connect the ``Low'' side of the one $\Delta$P transmitter to the top of the vessel to naturally compensate for vapor pressure.

\par} \vskip 10pt

Since the transmitter infers level from the amount of pressure sensed at the bottom of the vessel, any vapor pressure buildup inside the vessel will be falsely interpreted as additional liquid level, since the transmitter senses the {\it sum total} of hydrostatic pressure plus any vapor pressure trapped inside the vessel.

For example, if the process liquid level were at 10 feet (50\% of range), the hydrostatic pressure generated by the liquid column would be 120 inches W.C., assuming a specific gravity of 1.0, equal to water.  If, however, the vessel contained a vapor pressure equal to 15 inches W.C., this pressure would add with the 120 inches W.C. of pressure generated by liquid head to create 135 inches W.C. of total pressure sensed by the transmitter.  As a result, the transmitter would ``think'' it was detecting a liquid level of 11.25 feet (135 inches high) instead of the true level of 10 feet (120 inches high).  Essentially, any vapor pressure in the vessel results in a ``zero'' shift of the transmitter's indication.

In many applications, the gas pressure inside a vessel far exceeds the hydrostatic pressure generated by the column of liquid inside of it, so this problem can be a very serious one in level measurement.  We need to fully understand the nature of the problem and how to solve it in order to successfully measure liquid level in many industrial applications.

The solution to this dilemma is to measure the {\it difference} in pressure between the top and bottom of the vessel.  We could do this by using two pressure transmitters, one at the top and one at the bottom, and detect hydrostatic pressure by subtracting the top transmitter's measurement from the bottom transmitter's measurement.  A computer may be used to perform the mathematical subtraction of signals:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00248x03.eps}$$

Another, more elegant method, incorporates a {\it differential} pressure transmitter with pipe connections to both ends of the vessel.  This solution performs the subtraction mechanically, by directly exposing the transmitter's sensing element to the {\it difference} of two applied pressures:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i00248x04.eps}$$

Because the differential pressure transmitter solution requires only one sensing instrument rather than two, and results in better accuracy because we are only dealing with the inaccuracies of a single instrument rather than the compounded inaccuracies of two instruments (three, if you include the subtraction unit), the differential, or ``d/p'' solution is the one more widely used.

In this particular level measurement application, a differential pressure instrument would have the exact same calibration points (lower and upper range-values) as a ``normal'' pressure transmitter connected to an open vessel.

Determine the LRV and URV settings for the water seal drum lever transmitter (LT-21), assuming the LRV point is at the lower nozzle and the URV point is at the upper nozzle (the two nozzles being 3 feet 8 inches apart from each other), and that the remote seal fill fluid has a specific gravity of 0.934:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i0002rx01.eps}$$

\underbar{file i02820}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

The elevation for this transmitter (i.e. the total differential pressure applied by the height of fill fluid on both sides) is equal to the total height difference between the remote seal diaphragms multiplied by the specific gravity of the fill fluid:

$$P_{elevation} = (44 \hbox{ in})(0.934) = 41.1 \hbox{ "WC}$$

In the LRV condition, this is the only pressure seen by the transmitter.  Therefore, 41.1 "WC is the appropriate LRV setting for this transmitter.  If we assume that the ``H'' port of this DP transmitter connects to the lower nozzle, the LRV will be -44.1 "WC.  If we assume the ``H'' port connects to the upper nozzle, the LRV will be +41.4 "WC.

\vskip 10pt

In the URV condition, we have the exact same amount of elevation (the fill fluid inside the capillary tubes) but on the lower nozzle we have the hydrostatic pressure of 44 vertical inches of water (i.e. the water inside the seal drum).  Thus, in the URV condition the transmitter sees a differential pressure of:

$$P_{differential} = 44 \hbox{" WC} - 41.1 \hbox{ "WC} = 2.9 \hbox{ "WC}$$

If we assume the ``H'' port of this DP transmitter connects to the lower nozzle, the URV will be +2.9 "WC.  If we assume the ``H'' port of this DP transmitter connects to the upper nozzle, the URV will be -2.9 "WC.

This question is a good candidate for a ``Virtual Troubleshooting'' exercise.  Presenting the diagram to students, you first imagine in your own mind a particular fault in the system.  Then, you present one or more symptoms of that fault (something noticeable by an operator or other user of the system).  Students then propose various diagnostic tests to perform on this system to identify the nature and location of the fault, as though they were technicians trying to troubleshoot the problem.  Your job is to tell them what the result(s) would be for each of the proposed diagnostic tests, documenting those results where all the students can see.

During and after the exercise, it is good to ask students follow-up questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{} What does the result of the last diagnostic test tell you about the fault?
\item{} Suppose the results of the last diagnostic test were different.  What then would that result tell you about the fault?
\item{} Is the last diagnostic test the best one we could do?
\item{} What would be the ideal order of tests, to diagnose the problem in as few steps as possible?

Converting percentage values into flow rates is easy: simply multiply each percentage by the maximum (URV) flow rate.

\vskip 10pt

Converting percentage values into differential pressure values is a little trickier.  Since the orifice plate is inherently nonlinear -- generating differential pressure proportional to the {\it square} of the flow rate -- we must take the percentage of flow and then square that percentage to arrive at a percentage of DP.  This new (squared) percentage value is then multiplied by the URV of the pressure range to calculate DP.

\vskip 10pt

The flow transmitter itself is linear, and so it simply takes the sensed DP and converts it linearly to a milliamp output signal.

\vskip 10pt

The square root ``extractor'' (relay) takes in the transmitter's milliamp signal, square-roots that signal percentage, then generates its own milliamp signal representing percentage of flow.  The end-result is that the relay's milliamp signal is linear to actual flow rate.

A {\it V-notch weir} is a type of flow-sensing element for measuring liquid flow through open channels.  Its construction is similar to a dam, and the height of liquid (``head'') on its upstream side is related to flow rate over the weir by a nonlinear equation.

Suppose the height signal from a level transmitter upstream of a 60$^{o}$ V-notch weir gets sent to the analog input of a process recorder.  Displaying the height measurement directly on the recorder would not be very useful, because height ($H$) is not linearly proportional to flow rate ($Q$).  A human operator looking at a trend of head could not tell what this trend means in terms of {\it flow}, or worse yet might mistakenly interpret the head trend as a flow trend.  However, this recorder does have the feature of {\it characterization}, where you may enter an equation to ``linearize'' an otherwise non-linear signal.

\vskip 10pt

Write a ``linearization'' formula so that the trend recorder will be able to input the measured height ($H$, in inches) upstream of a 60$^{o}$ V-notch weir and display as a flow rate ($Q$) in units of cubic feet per second.

Note that I did not specify the nonlinear equation for a V-notch weir in the question.  This I left for you to research.  The characteristic formula for this type of weir (from the {\it Lessons In Industrial Instrumentation} textbook) is as follows:

$$Q = 2.48 \left( \tan {\theta \over 2} \right) H^{2.5} \hbox{\hskip 20pt V-notch weir}$$

\noindent
Where,

$Q$ = Volumetric flow rate (cubic feet per second -- CFS)

$L$ = Width of crest (feet)

$\theta$ = V-notch angle (degrees)

$H$ = Head (feet)

\vskip 10pt

Our task here is to modify this formula for use in this application, where the recorder receives a value for $H$ in units of inches, and must register cubic feet per second.  Since the formula as specified in the textbook assumes $H$ in feet of head rather than inches, we need to embed the inches-to-feet conversion in our modified formula, as well as the known angle of 60$^{o}$.  The result is shown in these three forms, each one in different stages of reduction:

$$Q = 2.48 \left[\tan \left(60 \over 2\right)\right] \left({H \over 12} \right)^{2.5}$$

$$Q = 2.48 (\tan 30) \left({H \over 12} \right)^{2.5}$$

$$Q = {2.48 \over \sqrt{3}} \left({H \over 12} \right)^{2.5}$$

$$Q = 1.43 \left({H \over 12} \right)^{2.5}$$

$$Q = 1.43 \left({H^{2.5} \over 498.83} \right)$$

$$Q = {1.43 \over 498.83} H^{2.5}$$

$$Q = 0.00287 H^{2.5}$$

What is a flow {\it prover}, and why is it periodically necessary to use one to re-calibrate positive-displacement flowmeters?

\underbar{file i00546}
\vskip 10pt \filbreak 





\svar{} 

A ``prover'' is a precision device used to measure a flow rate for a short period of time.  Provers are typically of the piston-and-cylinder design, measuring flow rate by timing how long it takes the piston to travel a certain distance (i.e. displace a certain volume of fluid).

Periodic re-calibration of positive-displacement flowmeters is necessary because they all suffer from internal friction and mechanical wear.

Suppose you are calibrating a panel-mounted indicator to be used for displaying flow rates, based on the signal coming from a (linear) DP transmitter sensing pressure across a venturi tube.  The DP transmitter is an analog electronic transmitter with a linear characteristic, which means the panel-mounted indicator must be configured for square-root characterization.

Calculate the ideal display value at the following input currents, assuming a calibrated range of 0 to 700 GPM for the indicator:

A pneumatic DP transmitter measures the flow of gasoline through a an orifice plate, using a separate square root extractor relay to characterize the signal so that it may be displayed linearly on the receiver gauge (FI-20):

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i03440x01.eps}$$

Based on other flow-measuring devices in this process, operations personnel have determined the actual flow rate through this pipe is 158 gallons per minute.  FI-20, however, registers a flow of 142 gallons per minute.  Based on the data you see in this illustration, determine the location of the calibration error.

\svar{} 

The error lies either with the DP transmitter (FT-20), unequal fluid inside the impulse tubes, or with the orifice plate itself (FE-20).  One quick check would be to drain the impulse tubes (allowing fresh process gasoline to fill the tubes) and seeing whether that fixes the problem.  It's a quick procedure and it would eliminate that problem from the realm of possibility.

Another way to diagnose the problem is to remove FT-20 from service and test its calibration with applied pressures to its ``H'' side port.  If FT-20 checks out okay, the problem must be with the impulse tubes or the orifice plate.

An important principle to bear in mind here is that the digital microprocessor inside the smart transmitter never makes arithmetic errors -- it {\it always} calculates the proper AO value for any given PV value.  Therefore, we should {\it always} expect the PV and AO figures displayed by the HART communicator to correspond perfectly with one another.

What will happen if there is a sensor trim error is that the transmitter will not ``see'' the real applied pressure: for any pressure applied to the sensor, the transmitter will register a PV value that is something different, and from there it will calculate what it thinks should be the correct milliamp output signal value.

If, however, there is an output (digital-to-analog converter) error, the transmitter will calculate the correct output signal value (AO) but this will not become the real milliamp current value output by the transmitter.

In summary, sensor trim errors cause the real input pressure to deviate from the PV value ``seen'' by the transmitter, while output trim errors cause the real current signal to deviate from the AO value calculated by the transmitter.  In no case will a trim error cause the PV and AO values to not correspond, because they are digitally calculated by the microprocessor which always performs perfect arithmetic.

For more help understanding these concepts, refer to this simplified block diagram of a ``smart'' pressure transmitter with analog (4-20 mA) output:

If the calibration error lies within the transmitter's sensor, then the analog output (AO) will read the same as the DMM and the process variable (PV) will deviate from the digital pressure gauge.  To predict the transmitter's PV and AO values, we set AO equal to the meter's indication (13.93 mA) and calculate what amount of sensed pressure would correspond to that amount of signal current.

\vskip 10pt

If the calibration error lies within the transmitter's output (DAC), then the analog output (AO) will deviate from the DMM and the process variable (PV) will read the same as the digital pressure gauge.  To predict the transmitter's PV and AO values, we set the PV equal to the pressure gauge's indication (37.80 "WC) and calculate what amount of output current would correspond to that amount of input pressure.

Suppose you are calibrating a DP transmitter to go into service as a flow transmitter, measuring differential pressure generated by a segmental wedge flow element.  This is a ``smart'' electronic transmitter with square-root characterization capability, which you decide to activate for this application.

What type of calibration error is this (e.g. {\it zero} shift, {\it span} shift, or {\it nonlinearity}), and do you suspect it lies with the sensor or with the digital-to-analog converter?  In other words, do you need to perform a {\it sensor trim} or an {\it output trim} on this instrument?

The calibration error is a {\it zero} shift (the actual output consistently 0.3 mA greater than it should be), and it resides in the DAC.  Thus, the transmitter needs its output to be trimmed.

Remember, the ``normal'' status of a switch is that state the switch is in when there is a {\it lack} of stimulus!  Therefore, a normally-closed flow switch will be closed when there is {\it no flow} going through it.

A flow measurement loop has a problem, and you are called to diagnose it.  According to the loop sheet, the transmitter is supposed to be configured with square-root characterization, while the indicator is supposed to be linear:

$$\includegraphics[width=15.5cm]{i04053x01.eps}$$

The DP transmitter's range is 0 to 100 inches water column, and the indicator's range is 0 to 250 GPM.  Disconnecting the transmitter from the orifice plate impulse tubes, you connect a hand pump and precision test gauge to the ``high'' input port and proceed to apply the following pressures to the transmitter, while calling a fellow technician over a hand-held radio to read what the indicator says, and watching the display of a digital multimeter as it measures the transmitter's output current.  The result is this table of values:

Determine the location of the problem in this loop, based on these measurements.  Also, explain why it is very helpful in your diagnosis to have the meter measurements of signal current, rather than just know what the indicator reads for each of the applied pressures.

\begin{itemize}
\item{} A valuable principle to apply in a diagnostic scenario such as this is {\it correspondence}: identifying which values agree with each other: applied pressure, current signal, and indicator.  Explain how a check of correspondence tells us which instrument is at fault in this system.

\item{} Supposing this was a flow {\it control} loop with a PID controller sensing the flow rate and adjusting a control valve's position in response, what would we have to do to the controller before proceeding with the hand pump test in a live process?  If we did not properly configure the controller prior to this test, how would our hand pump test affect the working loop as it tried to stabilize flow at setpoint?

The problem is in the transmitter's sensor (i.e. a ``sensor trim'' error): it has a +1 "W.C. zero-shift (i.e. it ``thinks'' the applied pressure is 1 "W.C. greater than it actually is).  We can tell that the calibration error lies before the square-root characterization and not after due to the nonlinearity of the error: we're off by 1.6 mA at the LRV, off by 0.089 mA at 80\%, and only off by 0.08 mA at the URV.  If the error were linear, it would have to lie somewhere after the square-root calculation.

\vskip 10pt

Having measurements of transmitter current is extremely helpful because it gives us data we may use to independently assess the calibration of the transmitter versus the calibration of the indicator.  Without this ``measurement in the middle,'' the transmitter and indicator act as a single instrument with one input and one output, making it difficult to discern which half of the loop has the problem.
