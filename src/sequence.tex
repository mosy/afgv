The particular sequence of courses you take during the second year depends on when you complete all first-year courses and enter the second year.  Since students enter the second year of Instrumentation at four different times (beginnings of Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters), the particular course sequence for any student will likely be different from the course sequence of classmates.

Some second-year courses are only offered in particular quarters with those quarters not having to be in sequence, while others are offered three out of the four quarters and must be taken in sequence.  The following layout shows four typical course sequences for second-year Instrumentation students, depending on when they first enter the second year of the program:
